Grandma has tired of it long before he has. Finding the items on each page that he can touch and activate is endlessly entertaining for him, at least for now. Well worth the $.99.

It's easy for little ones to operate and fun with all the things you can play with. The different generes are nice too, gives its a little variety.  Worth the money. Highly recommended!

The game itself keeps her occupied as everything she clicks on does something! There is an airplane that flies around the room, a telephone that rings and is plays a message, the lamp turns off the light and you see the monkeys eyes going up and down in the dark, a dog that barks when you click the window and then chases a cat out from under the bed every third time, the picture on the wall becomes an interactive portrait, the traffic light stops/starts the monkeys jumping, alarm clock rings, plant grows (and produces bananas), ball bounces, toy truck rumbles and honks.... lots to keep a toddler occupied! Oh! The monkeys jump on and fall off the bed! Mama calls the doctor, etc! It's great.

I love this! I absolutely recommend this!

They also could have had better or more tune options, they only offered 'rock', country', and 'pop', which I thought were horrible for this children's song. I do like that it's interactive. Everything you touch in the room does something different. Phone rings, dog chases the cat, door opens, clock goes off, etc.....neat. My daughter also enjoys all the other interactive features it has other than the monkeys falling off the bed. &#34;Wheels on the bus&#34; app by &#34;duck duck moose&#34; ranks higher because you have much more options like changing the language, gender voice options, instrumental, and self record which my daughter finds hilarious when she hears her own voice.  Overall it's ok and she likes to see the monkeys fall off the bed.

If I purchase songs I usually use iTunes but Rhapsody allows me to get songs and listen to them before I purchase them. However, some albums are only allowed to be purchased which I find annoying. I think they need to allow subscribers to get them for the fee. After all we can not keep them if we are not subscribers.

I have playlists for everyone in the family (me, hubby, and 10 year old son).  Works great on the PC and my MP3 players (no Apple products tested).  Also use with Sonos and that interface is also simple to use.Only complaint is that you can't customize your plan.  I want 2 MP3 players and I'd have to pay for 3.  It's an extra $70 a year.  I would only pay $2 a month for the second player, so I got a huge capacity MP3 and share.  Easy to do with playlists.

I have it on my phone, my computer and my Kindle Fire. I use it everyday, no matter what device it is on, it works great. It is a wonderful way to take your favorite music and playlists with you wherever you go, whatever you do. Be aware that you do have to have a subscription and I'm pretty sure the price can range from $10 and up per month.

Yes,after 14 days you have to pay $9.99 a month....but this app has helped keep my sanity. It is the first app that Amazon has put out for music that I have liked.

When I tried to download, there were several selections, but none seemed to match my Kindle Fire settings and the ones I tried to download, didn't make Rhapsody work either. There seemed to be two ways to access Rhapsody; one took me to all this problem of the download and the other was the pay for it monthly option. I deleted all the downloads & Rhapsody app off my Kindle.

The service has been reliable and a good value, but the latest smartphone and tablet apps take it to a new level.  The UI is much improved, intuative, and brings recommendations and new releases once available only on the desktop software.  Good work!
A1UTFW6LO2I0DR,B004AFQAUA,1.04838709677,0.502698412698,0.0183887915937,0.0,0.205,1.0,TRUTHFUL,I have used most every subscription music service and when it comes to their apps, Rhapsody's offers one of the best experiences. While Spotify revolves heavily around playlists and radio, Rhapsody has both and a whole lot more. It is much easier to navigate and find the music you are looking for and it includes easy access to your saved music library. Plus you can download individual tracks, albums, and playlists for offline play. Both the interface and visual appearance are very nice. The sound quality tops out at 192 kbps AAC+, which is not as high as some services, but sounds great from my experience. There is a lower setting if you need to save data usage. Any song in their library can be listened to on-demand (or as part of a playlist or radio station) through their app. All ad-free.The service itself requires a subscription, currently $10 per month. While they do have free trials, they do not currently have a free version of the service. So if you are not interested in subscribing or giving it a trial run, then this app is probably not for you.I use this app on my first generation Kindle Fire and so far no complaints.

Cons: songs did lots of skipping/jumping, even when I had 4 bars & 4G, and even online (though songs sometimes continued when coverage was bad); lacks the customization of thumbs up/down that I grew used to in Pandora; playlist UI isn't helpful - it shows a big view of the album of the currently playing song, then the list rolls of the screen, with no view of the upcoming song (you have to scroll all the way down the list); no lockscreen control; online there doesn't appear to be a way to create shortcuts to favorite radio stations; no scrobbling (there are some 3d party programs for online use). Will continue checking out Pandora, Tunewiki (really like the sync'd lyrics, when it works), Slacker, Winamp, Rdio, etc.

There are a lot of music programs and services out there now but I always come back to Rhapsody for a couple reasons.1.) I love their desktop app!!2.) I love being able to use the service with a REAL mp3 player, not just an android phone or ipod touch/iphone.  With the desktop app, the service works with Sandisk MP3 Players (Most are supported but check rhapsody before you purchase one)Now for this app.  The app on android and Kindle is great.  It gives you access, not just to their radio feature, but also to their "all you can eat" music service.  You can download the tracks to your phone for free (As long as you keep paying the monthly fee, these songs stay active".  Their "radio" feature is great if you like services like Pandora.  The Rhapsody radio doesn't have the ads like Pandora and other free radio services.  The radio feature is also very smart just like Pandora (Though I would say it is not as smart as Pandora).Overall this is a great app if you like music and like being able to choose what songs you want to listen to or if you wanna listen to an entire album!!  And the app doesn't bog the phone down with adds or video adds like Pandora!Try it for a month!! Most new phones and kindles will give you a free trial! If not you can use this link for one.. I was one over with the free trial I received when I downloaded this app to my Kindle[...]

The selection of music in the genres that I like to choose from is adequate...nothing great!!!  I only stay with them because I need to update the license every 30 days or so in order to listen to the music I have downloaded to my MP3 player.  But I am giving serious consideration to going to an alternative music source.  Reason you asked...the software is very &#34;unstable&#34; in my opinion.  It frequently locks up at the most inopportune times.  Obviously, this requires restarting the software program and reloading what I had already begun.  It happens so often, that it has become a pain in the backside.At this point, I would not be strongly recommending Rhapsody to others.

Competitors like Zune and Qriocity don't have a library anywhere near as deep as Rhapsody's.  But Rhapsody front ends on the Droid and the PC are sub-par.  The latest app update is better than the previous, but its still butt-ugly, and getting around feels harder than it needs to be.  They've added hi-def streaming to the latest version, and it sounds great.  A track still occassionaly drops, but I'm getting fewer of them now.Someone said that you need a higher priced subscription to use the PC software.  This isn't true, my 9.99/month subscription allows me to use the software on one mobile device and 3 PC's.But as far as the PC software goes, its simply awful.  Its supposed to handle downloads and transfers to your mobile device for offline listening, but I can't get it to work properly with my phone.  Its also hideously ugly (think old school Itunes).  Windows doesn't look like apple, so don't make an app that poorly emulates the look of an app that's already ugly.Great service...just wish they'd write better software, and hire someone who wasn't colorblind to build the interfaces.  Black and blue and gray...no real polish.Easy 5-stars if they bring their interfaces into the modern age, and make the PC version work right.  I've figured out how to download stuff to my phone for offline listening without the PC client, but a functioning client would make this so much more pleasant.They've released a web beta that looks pretty darn sharp--hoping they'll bring its look and feel down to the PC and Android soon and move the button/menu options around so I have less mis-taps.

Thanks to these wonderful people I have been able to expand my spiritual walk to measures unknown to me. My eyes have been opened to revelations and deep understanding that otherwise I had been ignorant to. By having and using this app my daily morning study gets me ready for the day and keeps my heart in tune with God.It is customizable to which content I decide to read and listen to. Because of the audio portion my spiritual walk has encountered a new path of what can only be described as an old friend. That is how he will make you feel after just a short listen. I am talking about Pastor McGee and his TTB Bible radio program. It is a five year journey through the entire Bible and no one has been able to explain it as he has.McGee has a unique view into the word of God and looking back he was indeed at the beginning movement of the Christian non denominational faith. He saw the way had been opened and how chains of hierarchy and rules of the old establishment were being abandoned.He is only one of many podcasts that are available, from daily to old sermons to modern convention speeches. Rick Warren has a spot there as well as Joyce Meyers and so many others.Daily reading plans and so many wonderful features.I have gained so much for so long that some time back I became a regular supporter  of their ministry for it is with these works that many are being baptized in the Holy Spirit.

It's nice that it even has audio because none of the other free bible apps I know of offer that.  My only beef is that sometimes the audio works, and sometimes it doesn't.  I guess it's not the app's fault.  Probably has something to do with the Sprint cellular network I'm on.  I would have preferred to have an option to save the files on my phone as opposed to getting them off the web every time I open it.  That way I'd have instant access to it.  I gave three stars however because despite its problems, the price is right.

I found it to be quite fun, if a bit too easy on the easy settings.Things that aren't in the instructions that people can't seem to figure out on their own:You place power station towers to recharge your towers. 3 were sufficient for me to beat the first level.When placing a tower, you tap the location you want it, and then you can drag your finger around anywhere on the screen to fine-tune the placement. Quite brilliant, that; it solves the problem of trying to carefully place the tower while it's under your thumb.Enemies come from left to right on the first level. I assumed the opposite, due to the background graphic.Overall, a pretty solid game. Runs well, no crashes, no lockups, freezes, or any other negative events. Graphics are suitable to what you would expect from a bubble popping TD game.-1 star for poor instructions, not that it wasn't hard to figure out; very easy, simple game.EVO 3D, FAOTD.

Not least among the issues is the horrible UI that I can safely say is the worse I have ever seen on a mobile phone game. If you got it for free from Amazon might be worth setting down with for a few minutes but I could never justify to myself spending any money for it.

The only saving grace is that it sort of saves your game just before it blitzes (except for the 1 time it destroyed all my towers upon reload).  If the FC gets fixed, I'll up the stars.  It's not bad enough for 1 star, but the FCs keep it a solid 2.  Other than that, it would be a 5.

I play it everyday, multiple times a day. Like others who have it a 1 star review I also like Jelly Defense and Plants vs Zombies; while the graphics may not be as good as those other games, I'm getting much more play time out of this. Jelly Defense took me a while to finish and was worth it (if I had paid for it, another Free App of Day), this one is taking me much much longer to finish.  I'd rather the graphics be lacking if the game can be played for many weeks, or more?I'm addicted to it. I just wish I knew a little more about how certain things work, I'm trying to figure these out. Like I recently learned upgrading the power stations is very important, not just buying more. Upgrade everything.Sometimes I notice a tower right next to a power station let all the things go by without shooting at any of them, I'd like to know what I'm doing wrong when that happens, but that's rare. Also I want to know what it means when a tower has that little power graphic flash or sometimes just stay solid. Does it mean it needs power? Like it wants to shoot but can't at the moment?So other than a wanting a few more instructions, I love the game. Even with the things I can't seem to figure out, it still gets 5 stars.I'm surprised by all the low ratings here and wonder if it's mostly people who dont like or know how to play defense games.I wish people would realize they should rate on the quality of the app, not on whether it's their type of app. The low ratings hurt the developer and cause them to sell less games.If you like defense games get it, if I was suddenly forced to pay for it now, I would definitely buy it, because after a few weeks of playing I have lots of play-time left. Actually, I think I'll end up moving on to a new game before ever finishing all these levels.

Most of the negatiave reviews are from people that don't understand the concept and were to lazy to try to understand...or perhaps just trolling, big surprise.  The initial towers you can purchase shoot once.  As you earn more coins you can upgrade to better towers, power stations etc.  Anyways, the game looks simple in appearance, but again it's just a simple TD game for your phone.  The two things i don't like were the instructions didn't mention that you can upgrade during waves, not just between waves.  Also, I couldn't slide towers across my screen.  I could only move them by touching the spot on my screen where i'd want them.  This was tedious at times because the tip of your finger isn't as accurate as if you were using a stylus.  Sliding would have been much easier.  HTC Thunderbolt stock.

This app doesn't offer much - it is a clunky game that lacks finesse, especially in level and unit design.The most frustrating part is that the towers are slow. They fire a single shot, and then take forever to reload. And thats plenty of time for a herd of bubbles to go whizzing by. Not much of a defense. It takes a while to figure out that you need to build and upgrade power stations to recharge your towers so they can fire more than once. The instructions aren't too helpful, either. The touchscreen is also laggy at times, which adds to the frustration.It might be easier to just include a button that lets you wave a white flag and surrender, rather than wait patiently for inevitable annihilation.There are many better TD games out there. This one is mediocre, at best.

However, why this developer keeps cranking out game apps that can't be moved to the external SD card remains a mystery and a concern. Yes, it's only a MB in size, and I can fit this app and a whole team of Clydesdale horses in my phone's internals, but for some folks, this will become an issue during app "spring cleaning," and apps like this will be the first to go.Second, wish I would have known the app has no sounds so I didn't have to spend time fiddling with phone settings, thinking it was my settings.Third, with all the same complaints about the power stations over at Google Market, you would think the developers would rethink the app and take them out.  They don't HAVE to -- it's THEIR game.  But if they want to make it OUR game on our devices and charge for it, they would be wise to just redesign it and give the people what they're begging for!  They should take the complaints about the towers for what they really are:  FREE development strategy advice being handed to them on a silver platter!Fourth, the gameplay.  Sadly, it is indeed laggy as many have reported, and coupled with the frustration of the towers, it's just not providing any fun.  If the towers are necessary to provide the energy, they shouldn't be so expensive.  I'm just not sure lowering their price is going to satisfy those who already have developed a distaste for their existence to begin with and, hence, not be the solution to end the complaints.Maribou may want to to take this app back to the drawing board and make these changes... or not.  Depends on whether they want to stay competitive in at least the tower defense market.  And if their ultimate goal is to have customers download multiple apps they create, then for heaven's sake -- let them go to the SD card to attract some non-rooted customers and those who are vigilant as to what they feel is necessary and important enough to take up precious phone space.

The instructions about the power sources is *PERFECTLY* clear. Just because the bulk of the one star reviewers are brainless mouthbreathers, who are incapable of comprehending basic English, doesn't mean this is a horrible game.Idiots aside, this is actually a fun little game and, IMHO, a nice variation of your typical tower defence game. The controls aren't perfect though. Placing the towers can be a little cumbersome in terms of fine tuning the location in a hurry. So meaning that after doing the initial click-to-place the &quot;dragging&quot; for fine tuning is very slow. ESC = 'back arrow'.Game plays just fine on my rooted / rom'd Charge.

In my opinion - it could use better descriptions of the towers in the help menu. It's never mentioned that you NEED a power station - or your towers just shoot once...  I think the icon on a tower once it's depleted it's power does a decent job, but that kind of information is critical to gameplay and should be clearly spelled out in the instructions somewhere.I initially went to the help menu because I tried to DRAG my tower to where I wanted to.  It moved amazingly slow.  I figured that COULDN'T be how it was supposed to be.  It wasn't.  The help screen let me know to touch the location where I wanted the tower and then drag it for fine tuning (which actually works well)."ESC to cancel" also isn't of much help on the single button kindle fire.  To cancel placing a tower on the kindle fire, hit the little arrow at the bottom of the screen that brings up your menu, then hit the "back" arrow.Something else I would REALLY like to see is a "restart level" option.  I've placed my towers wrong and I want to go back and do it all again.  I have to exit and save - go back to the main menu, choose the level, select to start fresh.  It would be a lot easier to have menu options to just start over.I like the fact that this game doesn't have crazy permission requirements - but I don't think it's a $2.99 game.

It took me a while to realize that the easiest way to build new towers is NOT to drag them, but click the tower you want to build and then click the place on the map you want to build it.  The game itself gives you strategy tips for the game in general during the 1st level.  The only other thing you need is your brain, and it's a decent tower defense game.  The only thing that could be improved is the graphics, and a forced tutorial level that makes you place certain towers and explains what they do.

It is a simple tower defense game and from that point of view it did what it said it would. It featured 13 different maps and it had a fast forward button to play through each attack at high speed. As long as you plant enough power towers to let your weapons fire you will have it made. You can gain enough points to update the weapons and vastly improve their power for killing the bubbles. The flying balloon weapons are nice as they can track the invaders along the route and continuously bring lethal fire down upon the bubbles. We all know air power rules the battle.I liked how the game did not ask for multiple permissions and finally someone listened to the users and stopped all of the intrusive requests.That being said I have to admit I am not much into tower defense games like this one. I played for quite a while but I just didn't find the game to be as much fun as others I have played. For me this was a 3 star game.

The graphics are lack luster, but fits the gameplay. I enjoy the depth the game has with the bubbles popping and creating additional bubbles. Reminds me of balloon pop, which is very fun. My only complaint is the ESC option to cancel laying down a tower... How do I do this?

When you go to start a level there is a paragraph that says right at the end that you HAVE TO HAVE POWER STATIONS to power your towers! Otherwise, yes, they'll only shoot once. It was obvious after playing around for only 5 minutes exactly what tower did what, &amp; how well everything worked. For those of you who can't read or have no common sense: the first little icon shoots one bullet at a time at incoming enemies.  Next icon, (ship wheel looking thing,) shoots out in all directions. Fire icon melts ice balls that will eventually come, or shoots one bullet at regular ones. Blue spiral thing...can't remember. Hot air balloon follows enemies &amp; shoots at them. Finally, the red power icon sets up a power station.While this game may not be goty material, nor is it amazing graphics-wise (they aren't bad, just simple) it's still a good tower defense game. With other higher quality TD games on the market, this one definitely isn't worth $2.99. It isn't worth the ridiculous reviews from a bunch of morons who haven't given it more than 10 seconds worth of play time, either!

Different type towers are needed for different types of baloons traveling the course. Bright colorful graphics show up well on Kindle Fire. There are a dozen or more layouts and about 5 difficulty levels so lots of replay value although I feel the regular price a bit high, in other words I probably wouldn't have paid the price but it's definitely a good app as the free app of the day. Thank you Amazon.

Yes, the graphics are a bit simple, and it isn't the best TD game out there, but it has been a nice addition to the library.  In my opinion, the 1-star reviews are unwarranted, and should be reserved for apps that really should be avoided.As for the permissions, this one really doesn't have any to speak of, so that's definitely a plus!Is it worth $3?  As much as we've enjoyed and played it, I'd say in hindsight yes.

Gameplay is garbage, clunky, and didn't make compared to other defense games.

I started the game read the directions and played just like any other game. The tower don't just shoot once, they start slow and progress as you play.I hate that the dev is getting slammed with lies but the one star reviews are not true, read the directions and the game plays fine.

It's really basic and not nearly as good as the other games out there because it's been around a lot longer. BB Defense and BB Defense 2 were big hits back when Blackberry had some of the best smartphones on the market. Android has come a long way in the last few years and developers have made better games. Now, I will give the poor reviews credit, the developer assumes that you have already played the first version of this game, which is why there are few instructions. But seriously people, giving this game 1 star is like a 10 year old saying the original Super Mario Bros for NES was a crap game. It's OLD people, that doesn't make it bad.

One of the first things the game tells you is that you need a power station. That is a poor concept, and without the power station your towers only fire once. The power station &quot;recharges&quot; your towers, but can't handle a lot of them unless you upgrade the station. I gave it a one star for no sound, poor instructions, no real options menu, the use of a &quot;power station&quot; that costs a much as a basic tower and is required, and really for just being a bad game.To the devs, if you are going to force the player to use a power station for the towers either lower the cost or raise the amount of gold players start with.

It's easy to play but hard to win, at least on all but the easiest level, so you'll actually have to plan out a strategy to get the win on each level, and it does get progressively harder, even if the action seems repetitive.

Trying to place a tower is so difficult, in that it is so slow to move across the screen as to render it unplayable.This could have been a nice sequel.  Instead it's a disaster.

Your phone has a timer and has Google maps.I'm all for duplicating what your phone already has but if your going to do it, it better be better than  what you already have (ex. sms vs handcent, go sms, etc) . If you want to find your car open Google maps star the location go away forget where you parked fire up Google maps again and look for the star on the map again.As for a timer there are a ton of free timers in the market there's one on your phone as well in the clock. Set a count down timer on your phone for the meter and your done.

Good thing I ignored the app because I found my car without its help.This is supposed to be a paid app and doesn't work. At all.

Got it on the Android market when it first came out. You paranoid kids are acting like the adults, terrified of every unknown, that you hate so much. Nothing about this app is intrusive or invasive.

Car locator *might* be for you.  It's pretty simple to use, and has a ton of extra features tossed in.  Simply tap the little guy in the corner and close the app.  Wen you open it again, it will show you which way you need to go to get back to your car.  Use it to take a pic of your spot and or the cars near you, just in case you need a little extra help or your car is damaged while you're away.  A lot of thought and effort went into Car Locator, and it's a handy little tool.  While obviously it's gear toward automotive use, realistically you can use it to find your way back to any spot you mark.The unhappy truth about this app though is that it relies on GPS location and a digital compass to lead you back.  While you can get away without having the digital compass, you're out of luck without GPS.  This can include times where you're in a spot where GPS signal is weak or non-existent, like a parking garage or around very tall structures.  How accurate Car Locator is is heavily dependent on how good a GPS and GPS signal you have, both at the time you mark your location and when you start trying to find your way back. In my testing, Car Locator was off by as much as 50 feet at times, which may not sound like much, but it's enough to put a good number of cars between you and where you want to be.Overall, I think it's a pretty cool app that will do what it claims if conditions are right.

This is for when you go to the mall and forget where you parked. The conspiracy theorists who say the dev steals your contacts are also idiots.

Especially in huge lots like at sports stadiums or concert venues. One place in particular I frequent is an outdoor amphitheater where there are many lots, widely scattered in fields over dozens of acres surrounding the pavilion. So, I downloaded this app and began testing it out. I must say, I'm impressed by the layout, ease of use and many thoughtful features included. I especially like the feature that allows you to text-message the car's location to others in your group. At concerts or sporting events this is a nice feature to have if people get separated from the main group. Of course, this app is not just useful for finding cars - it can be used to remember any given location - say, your hotel when you're traveling in a large, unfamiliar city. I realize Google Maps can handle much of the same functionality but it's nice to have a dedicated app devoted to just one purpose.I've tested this app out and found it to be precise, accurate (to within 9 feet!) and easy to use. The user interface is simple, attractive and logically laid out. Pop-up tips explain everything the app is doing, and provides advice if you need it. It invokes Google Maps for street directions if you wish, and even allows you to take a picture of the surrounding area where the car is parked in order to help you get a better mental fix on your car's location when you're getting close.The built-in timer is a handy way of knowing when it's time to put more quarters in the parking meter. You can set the app to throw a notification when your car has been parked for the length of time that you choose. Tip: If you use this to time parking meters, it might be a good idea to set that timer for a few minutes less than the timer on the parking meter. that gives you enough time to walk back to the meter and feed it more coins. Who knows, it might save you from getting a parking ticket!There are a number of permissions involved with using this app, but they all square with the intended functions of the app, so I don't understand why so many people here are so leery of what permissions are needed.In summary, there is simply no excuse for not being able to find your vehicle if you have this nicely-designed app. This is much better than just using Google Maps, in my opinion.

That said, my truck sticks out like a sore thumb and I usually remember where I park. The times I HAVE used it, mostly for testing purposes, it worked like a charm.I did use this when parking in some paid-parking one time. It was nice to see how long I was parked there and made sure I returned to the right place. I can't say it saved me money, but I do think it saved me some worry.I think four bucks is a bit steep, but I would have gladly paid four bucks that day in L.A.!

Unfortunately, doing that usually leaves me exhausted and in pain making remembering where we parked very difficult. Having one less thing to have to remember at the end of a shopping trip with the kids, regardless of whether I'm in my chair or not, is remarkably helpful.  All of that said, remembering where the car is isn't my favorite feature.  Being able to share where I am with my husband when I get tired when we're out, especially out with the kids, and have gone in different directions to save time is a Godsend.Not only is this app a convenience, but it's actually helped me feel more independent and more safe.

Oh man...can you people READ?? First, do you see a tracking device for your car that magically appears when you download it? Oh, you don&apos;t? Well then THATs why it isnt tracking your car. Its to find your parked car where you left it. Secondly look at the details you 1 star trolls. It needs that permission to do its thing. You really think the dev left ALL these comments and gets off on secret pictures of your cars? Yeah, okay. :) App works great.

Many freebie apps have also appeared since then and you can even roll your own with scripting apps like Tasker. The original Car Locator is still the best of the bunch, though. Now that it is the free app of the day, don't bother with any of the others (today anyway).Yes it does ask for a lot of permissions and the Amazon marketplace is really awful about describing those to you before download an app. If you are worried, go to the regular Android marketplace and compare the feature list to the permission list before you download. The permissions are reasonable for the features you are getting.

It's not something that I'll use a lot, but is a must for when you do need it! I recently used it for the first time at the Georgia vs Florida football game in Jacksonville, FL. If anyone has been there, you know parking is crazy an you may be a mile from the stadium if you don't want to pay $50 or more for parking, which I don't! I was in a new town, with cars an people everywhere, not really knowing where I was. The app marked my car perfect, an i could even see the sidewalk that was by my car on the map. The app actually showed the stadium too so I knew which direction to walk. When the tailgating party an game was over, it led me right back to my car perfectly!! Everyone that rode with me was highly impressed with the app, and so was I. Thanks for this awesome and helpful app!!

But there are apps that do it just as well for free, search the market. Most people don't need this on a day-to-day basis(at least I hope not). And the couple times I thought this would come in handy, I wasn't getting a good gps signal in the area, after that and a force close, I ended up finding the car by the time I actually had brought up the location on the map. If finding where you parked is a constant problem for you, by all means try this one out. But for most people, the free ones are going to do more than enough.Droid X

Sometimes it is spot on but other times it is WAY OFF.Originally installed this on my Optimus S about a year ago but it didn't always find the car, and it was a HUGE battery hog, so I uninstalled it back then.I thought maybe the app has been updated in past year and the problems would be fixed, so I downloaded the newest version and tried it again. Still the same problems. The app is constantly running in the background and seriously drains the battery. It runs in the background even after rebooting the phone, and restarts itself even after being force closed. Obviously the dev doesn't care since it's been just over a year and a lot of people are still complaining about the same things they were 1 year ago.Great idea but poorly executed. Pity, I really hoped the app would have worked right after all this time.

To the doubters of the usefulness of a reliable, simple to use version of this type of app: I&apos;d like to take you to an unfamiliar box box store, blindfold you, spin you until you are dizzy, then leave you in a random back corner. Your choice, the free version a seventeen year old kid did while waiting for levels of Call of Duty to load, or one that costs a few bucks from a professional developer.

It does find the car with no problem.  I only gave it 3 stars, because the app runs and depleates the battery on my phone.

Enter your zip code and cable company one time and the app remembers these settings. One swipe of the thumb and you are looking at complete, detailed listings for your area, starting with the current time. You have the option to scroll backwards and forwards to see what you might have missed, or what's coming on later. Very nice!

This app found them all when I provided my zip code.  It permits easy 'filtering' to delete those that are of no interest.  After deleting ones of no interest, it lists all the remaining (in my case 23) in increasing numerical order.  For each channel in this window it gives three listings, what's currently on, and the next two listings.  What I found wonderfully valuable, when a channel from this list is clicked-on, it opens another window that shows all the listings for that one channel for the rest of the day, and even into the next day, along with a detail description of each listing.  It also allows one to scroll back in time to see what was on earlier, so one can see if a desired show has been missed.My Samsung 46" HDTV has a nice TV listing capability, but this 'TV' app is even better.A few additional comments (room for improvement):- when in the detailed listings window for one channel, clicking on the back arrow on the Kindle-Fire returns one to the 'main' TV window.- the search feature, which is accessed via the magnifying glass icon on the Kindle Fire menu bar, only searches current programs.- there is no 'help' or instruction page, but except for a few items like the above, most are self-event.02/08/14 UPDATE:Since the `upgrade' of the `TV Listing' app in December 2013 the channel filtering capability has become unreliable, making this app far less user friendly than it was prior.  As such I've downgraded my rating to 3 stars.While many channels can be successfully filtered-out (in my case 120), they typically reappear after one or two additional uses of the app; that is, exiting the app and returning to it at a later time.I've come to learn that the created filter is not lost, but is simply not being applied.  A total reboot of my Kindle Fire tablet does, in fact, result in the filter being applied without having to recreate it.  However, rebooting the KF is time-consuming, and otherwise of no value (The KF sleeps beautifully with no noticeable battery drain, and it wakes from sleep much, much faster than the time it takes to reboot it.)We user's will of course be very grateful when the channel filtering capability is returned to its former reliability.The TV app is otherwise a great app.  When, and if, the channel filtering is returned to its prior functionality I will again update this review and upgrade my star rating.04/27/14 UPDATE:As of the April 2014 upgrade of `TV Listing', the channel filtering capability now works perfectly.  Along with other improvements such as the capability to separately list movies, sports, documentaries, etc. for not only the current day, but also for any day in the following week, this app is outstanding.  It now also has a search capability to find a specific desired showing, as well the ability to set an Alert in advance of a desired presentation (my Kindle Fire gives off a loud buzz).  This app now easily deserves a full 5 star rating, and then some!

Lacking a lot, hopefully it will make changes in the future or Amazon can get the real TV app. But I won't hold my breath. I'm still waiting for them to carry some locale apps that both of the other big name apps download sites carry yet Amazon doesn't if they can't produce the apps for kindle like Google or ios site they need to get out of the app business. I love my Kindle except for this issue. As it is now you need to carry two devises to get the apps you need

I don't have to log in (otherwise I'd probably have just used the listings by my cable provider).  I can also remove the channels I don't watch.  That means if I'm watching to just relax I don't have to look at any of the news channels, financial channels, sales channels, or programs in languages that I don't understand.  This is really convenient and useful.  And best of all FREE!!!

I like the display on iTV better because it shows the channels in a list and the times across the top of the screen like the typical TV guide that I'm used to and you can scroll ahead on the times. I tried this one because sometimes iTV is glitchy and I wondered if I could find a more reliable app but even if this one is more reliable, the difference in display wasn't worth it for me.Amendment: After further problems with other apps, I've gone back to this one. It's more reliable and has not once caused a problem on my Nexus 7. You can move ahead to look at the times or look at the schedule for an individual channel.

The only room for improvement would be to give those of us who use both an antenna and cable a chance to have both sets of listings displayed at once, but I found a second listings app that I use for the over the air channels.

Can click on a channel and get the listing for the day in one place.  The search function leaves me frustrated, but haven't really spent much time with it.  Usually try once and give up (don't want to take the time to figure it out or when it seems to skip what I have typed in??????).

It's easy to use. You can look ahead to see what is coming on later in the day, or the next day.I would give it a 5 star rating if it weren't for the fact that the app can be buggy on occasion. But hey --- it's free and it's so good in so many other ways, I'm not going to complain too much.

But in order to even be notified about a program that is coming on you have to leave the program running in the background. Ultimately making you force close it. Might be usefull to select individuals that can't get something else.
AMXIM9J0CWMNV,B004ANMWPY,0.229508196721,0.8,0.03125,0.0,0.02,0,TRUTHFUL,Just loaded this app and,  so far,  am enjoying it.  It seems to be just what I was looking for.

You can configure your TV provider and select the channels that you want to see.  The only real issue I've had ongoing is that it occasionally adds additional channels that I am not interested in and I have to remove them, but I can do this from the main screen, so it isn't a big deal.Recently (the past couple of months), however, it keeps losing the configuration info.  It still knows my provider, but the channels I am not interested are no longer excluded.  There are over 700 channels with my TV provider and while most that I am interested in are at the beginning of the list, there are some that are not and it is a pain to scroll to find them.  It takes a couple of minutes to reconfigure.  There are options in the configuration screen for &#34;select all&#34; and &#34;deselect all&#34;, which is great because with so many channels, I can deselect and then simply select the ones I want, but the fact that I recently have to keep doing this is a deal-breaker.I waited to post such a review because I wanted to give the developer a chance to correct, but apparently they are either unaware of the problem or uninterested in fixing it.  In the meantime, I will be looking for a new tool to get my TV listings.I am running on a Kindle Fire HD.

You can find info about over the air programs, satellite, and cable. You can narrow your search to only the channels you want.Maybe I just don't know how to save my choices, but when I switch between satellite and over the air (OTA) programs I lose my selection of favorite channels. Then when I switch back to OTA I have lost those favorites, also. This is the only drawback to this app that I see. If this problem was worked out (or if I find out how to do it right) I would definitely give it 5 stars.This is still a good app since my TV doesn't show me info on OTA programs in advance.Thanks to the developer for making this a free app.

For programs in Hi Def, you have to go to "On Demand" for each of the premium channels.That may not make sense to you, but there isn't much sense about 900 channels to begin with. And that's where TV Listings for Android comes in. I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire, and up popped 900 programs for every half-hour on almost every channel we get. And THAT was great except that I don't ever watch 830 of those channels.In order to "delete" the channels that you don't watch, you have to check them off and delete them one at a time. This would rate 5 stars plus if there was a way to block, say channel 300 through 699 and delete them. After that, there's another group of 200 channels, and then I wouldn't mind picking out individual channels.Right now, even after some selection, when I want to see what's on at 9 PM, I'll get a list of 400 programs.Now, if that app would like to go a step further, I'd like to be able to delete individual programs that I will never watch ... like Tivo.

We only get over the air channels now. It's rather quaint...there's a small selection of channels, but I typically find something on when I want to watch. It's like when we were kids....good sitcoms in evenings, family stuff in afternoons, kids stuff after school and cartoons on Saturdays, and garbage during the daytime except on one channel which runs stuff like Mr. Ed, I Dream of Jeannie, and McHale's Navy....real fun shows! This app helps us to see what's on. It's easy to browse since we don't have many stations. I set some timers for tomorrow to see how those work. I don't mind the ads as long as they don't flash ...developers need to get  paid for their service. More categories would be nice...Westerns please!

You enter your ZIP Code, pick your television provider, and boom - TV Listings. For further control, you can filter only the channels you want to see listed and move to any time of day you wish. I use this quite regularly, it is way quicker than watching the TV Guide channel and this app is far superior to the TV Guide official app (which is pretty bloated).UPDATE December 2 2013: The latest version of this app is severely crippled by a bug. You can filter out channels that you don't want to see in the listings, but the app forgets the channels you have filtered every time you launch it. To me, this severely decreases the usefulness of the app. I'll be looking for an alternative.

If you want to check the listings its great for that, it doesn't do much else. I would have liked to have maybe show previews. It works well on the Kindle Fire with no issues. It definitely saves the trouble of going through the listings, it's a quick and easy way to find what you are looking for and get a reminder of what's coming up. Basic and functional. I would recommend if basic and functional is what you are looking for.

However, the newest versions of TV Guide leave a lot to be desired, in my opinion.Along comes this App which I stumbled across purely by accident...but it's absolutely stellar.It's like having a virtual TV Guide on my tablet and my phone.  I especially like that I can filter out channels that I'm not interested in.  I have filtered out all of the shopping networks and several of the news networks, along with all of the country music channels and ALL of the "Music playing on a blank screen" channels.The search feature works great, and the other major feature that I truly love is the fact that you can quickly select "Movies, Sports, or What's On" right from the main menu.  That way you can quickly search for those several different types of items.I am giving this App five stars, but there are a few improvements that I would LOVE to see.  More auto filters would be great...such as "Comedy, Drama, Documentary, etc."  I would LOVE to be able to hit "Drama" and see which episodes of "Law and Order" are on at any given time.Overall, however, this is an awesome app and I'm REALLY glad I stumbled on it.I would gladly pay a few dollars for the App if there were a paid version.  Highly recommended.

There are a lot of apps out there and it's hard to chose,  most want money and what seems like your soul too.  But this one really works, there is no confusion. It gave me just what I wanted. So far so good.I'll recommend this one.

A3H1WUQ32VMLL2,B004ANMWPY,0.770491803279,0.485993953137,0.0232358003442,0.0,0.428,0,TRUTHFUL,I got this app to replace BuddyTV, which I liked better, but had some problems with. The best feature of this app is speed, but the navigation could be better - see below for more details.PROS: The interface is simple and uncluttered, and it's very fast. Setup is pretty intuitive. You can set reminders within the program, or use the Share with Friends feature to send it to your notes or reminders apps (which it detects automatically). The Share option also detects email and messaging apps, not just social media accounts (I don't have any set up, so I don't know whether it detects those, but the auto-detect seems strong, so I imagine it does. But it won't prompt you to log in to social media accounts you don't have or want like many apps do).CONS: Rather than a grid, it shows the next 3 shows for the selected time in list view for each channel, which is not ideal for planning an evening of viewing. The link to change the time is tiny, and hard to open without tapping the channel below it instead. Scrolling is oversensitive, so it's tough to get it to a specific channel without going past it. A giant ad fills the second screen as you scroll down, which makes it especially difficult to scroll to the channels right above and below the ad (which happen to be the ones I watch most). You can set favorite channels, but after it's been running in the background for awhile, it forgets them. There is no favorites button to bring them back, and refreshing doesn't help. You have to go back to your home screen and reclick the icon, sometimes 2-3 times to get it to show your favorites again. The reminder times are preset, with no custom option (so it will remind 5 or 15 minutes before program, but not 10). This is a minor issue, with an easy workaround, however - as mentioned in Pros, it auto-detects your reminder and notes apps through the Share with a Friend function, so you can swiftly export to another app with customizable time settings.CONCLUSION: All-in-all, this app is just OK, although it is faster and simpler than most. A few navigation tweaks (larger and better separated time changing button, smaller ads, slower scroll) and fixing the favorites caching problem could build on that to give it a major leg up over the crowd, but as it is now, I'm ready to jump ship if I find anything better.

It gives you a clear listing of what's on as well as what's coming up in the next couple of hours, and with a tap you can zoom in on more details about the program and the channel.

It had an acceptable, nonintrusive banner ad at the bottom.Now due to massive ads, the listings take up no more than one third of the screen! Even when clicking on the ad and going to its website, it remains when returning to TV Listings.A previously great app is now essentially useless and beyond frustrating when you want to quickly see what's on television right now. All because of the developer's greed and complete lack of concern for its customers.This app currently has an average rating of 4 stars, which was well deserved before. It has no longer earned the right to be rewarded with a high rating nor to have customers show their support by downloading it.Until the developer has a change of heart, I urge everyone to refrain from downloading this useless program and that all past reviewers change their rating to one star... since, unfortunately, it is no longer a 5-star app.

This new version, while glitzier, is buggy. Sometimes works, sometimes won't connect to my network. Also the previous version allowed you see TV schedules several days into the future; I can't find how to do that now and the channel filtering is more laborious. I'm giving 3 stars because when it works it's okay but as it is it's way too undependable in this new iteration. If all the kinks are worked out I'll edit this review. However, since the old version worked so well why can't they just 'downgrade' back to it (or 'upgrade' back to the old version)?To top it all off I tried the 'Contact Us' button. It asked for my email address as was expected. What was not expected was asking for my email password - wtf!!! To say the least I aborted my attempt at contact. Seemed like an attempt at phishing or ID theft to me.4-7-14 UPDATE: I found the feature that allows you to see future schedules but only for one particular channel at a time. In order to see future schedules you must tap on each individual channel. Again, cumbersome and laborious. Also when I opened the program today I found all OTA channels listed - not filtered for my channels. Oh boy, how long is it going to take to get it right??!!! Have downgraded to two stars.

With the most recent update, the TV Listings by TV24 does almost everything I want. It is easy to save just the channels I want and I can select a specific program to get more details. Two more things would make this the all-time most perfect app: 1) Provide an option to view in a grid (my personal preference) and 2) Allow the ability to open the app on a computer to print the listings to share with the family.Great job! I plan to tell everyone I know about this app!

I do receive cable channel info.  It is better than a paper guide.  There is no info for Sundance Channel and I watch that a lot.  It is most convienent to scan channels on a format that has 3 hour programs posted ahead of that time.  You can plan ahead on what you would like to watch.  This was an easy download and you pick your cable station, etc. which it lists (every possible choice). Pretty neat app...a keeper.  Try it...you'll like it!

Works better then any other apps.  Set it up to your area and then remove the channels you don't want and then whenever you bring it up its all up to date and ready to go.  Works well on my fire.  Would reccommend to anyone who can't always keep track of there favorite shows.  Tells you what the episode is about and if its an old or new episode.  Love it!

When I updated my PC to Windows8, I lost my Charter cablechannel tv guide app on my Kindle Fire and PC. it was really a struggle to get the channel guide and I didn't want to pay the $5 graft addition to Charter cable for the box to get the guide. Thus I found this app for my Kindle Fire TV Listings for Android which enables me to check the local cable channel guide while I am viewing my TV. Maybe small thing to others but a big deal for me since I like the basics. Thanks a ton! Amazon. If you are like me with extended basic cable and don't have the box to let you know what is on TV this is a must have for your android device.

Under Settings I should be able to "Filter channels" so that I can scroll through only those channels in which I am interested instead of all 542 of them (similar to the Comcast Favorites feature).  This feature works for a while then loses my input and I am back to scrolling through 542 channels.  I'll put this app on the back burner until they get this issue resolved.

The type of cable that I have has a 'guide channel' instead of one you can scroll through, and it circles through each of the channels VERY slowly. The music on this channel is also SO annoying, so I really wanted to find a way that I could just quickly look through the channels to find something good. I found a website that worked okay (titanTV) but many of the channel numbers or programs were often incorrect. I got this app just on the off chance that it would work better, and it DOES! It's so easy to use, and (thus far) everything it's said has been right. Fabulous app; a must for any avid TV watcher.

Once selected, you'll see every channel available and what is on now and the next two programs to come along with their respective times. Select the channel and it'll take you to a screen that shows you what programs will play throughout the day and each with detailed episode description. Now you'll know whether your favorite show is a rerun or worth recording it on TiVo&reg;. While I wish it could allow you to remove channels you don't have (or want), still it's an extremely useful app to make your TV watching more fruitful and enjoyable.

You used to be able to pick just the channels you want to follow.  Alas... the &quot;new and improved version&quot; does not save the channels picked.  Yes you can pick the channels but when you go  back into the app all the channels you didn't  want to see are back.  The list is long to scroll thru if you are only interested in a few channels.  I have tried to save numerous times but it keeps bringing up all the channels.  I should have just stayed with the old version.

Truly intuitive, efficient and complete.  It is, by far, my most used application. I am very grateful to have received my Fire as a gift from my wife and to discover this application, just as the void of a Tv guide solution was needed.  I have 100 csble channels and am lucky to find one thing worth watching within a 24 hour period. This app gives you the best possible chance of finding that one episode. My only suggestion would be to add ratings to help search for new favorites - something we all value infinitely on Amazon.  That was, everytime they cancel the only show that doesn't suck (e.g. Prime Suspect, Lie to Me, Medium, etc.) t will be helpful in watching for a new replacement.

Im editing my review as this app is the best tv channel guide I have found. This one is a keeper.

It's been a much more stable and better performer this time around. I'm upgrading it from two to three stars for this "second wind" improvement.-------------------------Original Review follows:On my Kindle Fire: I installed it, set it up with my zip code and TV provider (OTA), and it found all the channels and displayed the listings. Sweet!  Or so I thought. That was yesterday. This evening, I opened the app again, and found only one obscure station listed, not even one we get. And it refused to populate with the actual channels we get, even with re-searching and re-setting. Couldn't get it to do anything except show one oddball channel.On my Asus EEE Transformer TF101: Same experience, very good performance yesterday, and then crash-and-burn tonight.Needless to say I've uninstalled it from both devices. It's very disappointing! This app did just what I wanted, when it worked. Too bad, so sad.So far, an app called i.TV seems to be doing better. But then, I just installed that one tonight. Who knows what it will do tomorrow?

Good thing it's free, because it isn't worth any money. If you do manage to get to it, set up isn't as hard as other users have reported.  There is an option to deselect all channels and select only those channels you want to view.  But why bother if it can't find listings on a regular basis?

You can see up to three half hour blacks per channel on a quick scan. But there's a block of all the times on the top. It seems there can be a showing per block. This isn't a huge deal but I mostly like to use this app to confirm a showing I'm seeing later.I like the summaries. But I don't like they only show one at a time. You click on the channel and it shows one summary. For the next one, you have to load into a new page.I tried both orientations (portrait and landscape) to see if it's any different and it's not.Also the massive ad in the middle is pretty annoying. So here's a review since the app keeps asking for one.

A1MFO2DXH2C2B5,B004ANMWPY,0.770491803279,0.484477124183,0.0463995943205,0.0,0.694,0.764705882353,TRUTHFUL,This was a first for me... TV Listings by Jersey completely drained my battery.I was so disappointed with TV Listings that I compared it to TV Guide.  In fairness, this isn't in-depth; there may be non-intuitive ways to do things I couldn't quickly find.Configuration:TV Listings takes longer than TV Guide to start-up.TV Listings and TV Guide both have providers.  Neither has packages, so if you have, e.g., Dish HD with ~150 channels, you still have 1200+ listedYou can reduce those visible by setting "Favorites" in TV Guide or "Filter" in TV Listings.  This is easier in TV Listings; they're on one screen with checkboxes, like the Dish Network "Favorites" screen.  In TV Guide, it seems you have to click on each channel from the listing page and then add it to your Favorites, which is much much slower.Search:TV Listings has a terrible search.  It's slow but works, but only shows results for the current-grid half-hour.  So if you search for "Charmed" (which is in heavy rotation these days), you don't get ANY displayed results if it isn't on NOW.  You can hit "+" or "-" to switch time slots, but that takes another 25 seconds and you have to repeat and repeat and repeat to find if it's showing today.  So if you want to find out when "Training Your Dragon" is playing, you're out of luck.TV Guide search works as you would expect.  Results are listed by day, all retrieved at once, and easy to scroll through.  And you can organize by Date, alphabetically by Title (though since you still have to expand the letter-groups, that's of limited apparent value), and Genre (e.g. Movie, Lifestyle, Childrens.)  And it's faster.Device Support:TV Listings completely ignores Landscape mode.  Even with the physical keyboard open, it's Landscape.  TV Guide supports Landscape somewhat; things rotate (easier to type in searches), but the ribbon bar with "Search", "Favorites", etc. is blank.Neither program allows you to scroll to the next timeslot with a finger-swipe.TV Listings U.I. Notes:My biggest gripe with TV Listings is that every action incurs a delay.The Listing screen is nice; it shows the current and next few shows for each channel.  On my device, that's four channels per screen.  Clicking on the channel shows the listing for that channel."Return" does what I would expect in TV Listings.TV Guide U.I. Notes:My biggest gripe with the TV Guide U.I. is that the "return" button, which should go to the previous screen, instead tries to exit the app.The Listing screen shows the current show... what you are probably used to seeing.  Five per screen on my device, with space also taken by a large ribbon ("TV Listings", "Favorites", "Search", "News"), by the nave list and by a blank space that may typically be used for advertising.  (Most ad servers are blocked on my phone.)To see every show on a channel, click on the channel icon on the Listings page and choose a day.Summary: This is an odd situation where you can't go RIGHT with either choice.  TV Listings has a terrible search-results presentation and dreadful lag, and killed my battery.  TV Guide has lag I would have considered dreadful if not for TV Listings being worse, an abysmal filter/favorites configuration and bad choice of how to use the "return" key.  But I find the TV Guide search facility far more useful than the TV Listings one, because being able to easily search across times is the really important part of "search".Update 20 April 2012: A year later, I tried it again.  And still the same flaws.  Even on the Kindle Fire.  Default providers - 1300 or so channels for Dish.  You must deselect or select manually; it can't even distinguish between HD and standard def, so by default you get two copies of many channels.  And the Search is still only for the specifically selected time... you can't find a movie or when the show will next be on, just what's on now.Which means that not only was this weak a year ago, but it hasn't improved.  Huh.

I'm dyslexic and have always found numbers and letters matrix difficult to follow.  I'll never overcome the problem but I hope to patch it up a bit.  This app has been a terrific aid in learning the Sudoku puzzles and although I still make a lot of mistakes I believe the game and this app have helped me.  BUT there is an annoying rating (or grading) page at the end of the puzzles that pops up and reminds me that some super duper whizz bang player/s completed the same puzzle in seven to ten percent of the time it took me and that sometimes dozens of others completed it in less than twenty percent of my time.  In my view Sudoku is like golf where the player's biggest opponent is the player him/her self.  A golfer completes a round and finishes first in a foursome only to have someone in the clubhouse announce "that score stinks compared to the top finishers at "The Masters".  I realize this reads like sour grapes from a looser but like golf and other competitions the players take to the same fields of competition but the super players are only ranked against those of equal skill and talent.Other wise I rate this full five star app.

Minor issueThe Verdict: You will be hard pressed to find a more comprehensive and enjoyable sudoku game out there for Android. 4 out of 5 stars merely because the user interface could use some visual styling improvements.

The interface is enjoyable to use. The hint feature gives you just enough and allows you to ask for more. The best part of Enjoy Sudoku is the Learn button, which teaches you strategies to become a better player. Excellent app.

I tried the free version of this one first and was so impressed that I bought the paid version just because I believe the developer has earned it. The layout works well and you can customize the interface to work the way YOU want. That is nice. What sets this apart is the hint system. It's not about solving the puzzle you are working on, but learning HOW to solve so you can do it yourself in the future. When I first started using the app I was working (and struggling) at the Intricate difficulty level (there are 13 levels of difficulty - Intricate is 7th). Now I'm regularly working at Annoying (9th) and can make serious attempts at Devious (10) and Fiendish (11). I subscribe to the saying "Give a man a fish, he eats for a day, teach a man to fish and he eats for a lifetime." This app teaches you how to complete puzzles using the most advanced logic. Very highly recommended!

And so far, hands down, this is the best one.  I would have been willing to pick this one up for three bucks if I didn't already have it for free (yay, free Apps on Amazon).What I love about this more than the other apps is that you choose a number then the square you want to put it in.  Usually it is the opposite.  When you choose the number all the spots you've already chosen that number light up, making it easy to see if you are making a mistake or not.So, full marks for having something that is fun and challenging, giving a lot of options, and properly using all of the screen real estate to the best of its potential.  If you love Sudoku you HAVE to purchase this app.

It is better than any I've used in a browser or as a download game on my computer.It includes 3 tutorial lessons, and then 13 different skill levels.It compares your times to those of many other players to show you how you're doing, statistically.You can use "Hint" > "Check Entries" at any time without penalty --it won't respond with "Everything is just fine," until you've entered all of the essential pencil marks-- or else you can take advantage of their graduated hint system or automatic pencil marks.You can also enter the given digits of a printed puzzle in order to solve it within this game.You don't have to have Internet access at the time you are playing:  you can play while your phone is in "airplane mode".

All the little extras attached to each game like letting you know when a wrong move was made, when you have successfully gotten a series of numbers, etc. make it a joy to play.

I never quite understood the draw, so this review is that of a sudoku rookie. With that in mind I love this app. I have used it everyday since installing. One feature I really enjoy are the vocabulary lessons, and the wide range of skill levels. This is a well designed app, with no strange permissions and the price to entertainment ratio is great.

I absolutely love this sudoku app. Very intuitive controls, many features that make the game easier to play but don't take the challenge out of the game. A lot of personalization options allow everyone to play how they are most comfortable. Definitely worth the money to be able to play more than one of each level every day.

I personally think the home screen looks a little cheezy, but that'd a pretty superficial reason to scratch a point off.  I guess I'm superficial.

But this one is by far the best i've used. I can't say that it's worth $3 for everyone, as i'm not personally a hardcore sudoku guy. But really, the tutorials really make this worth it. The hard puzzles are actually challenging. Theres no shortage of puzzles. The highlighting system rocks, as well as the best hinting system i've seen..I need a lot of hints ^_^ so I very much appreciate the attention to detail there. The main menu doesn't look like anything special, but the actual board is clean and clear. Nice job, and definitely worth the money for people who love sudoku.

One occassionally fouled up so that I couldn't even finish the game. This one has 2-3 options for how to use the pencil mark and guess for a square. It also has several helps, which I have an option to use or not at my preference. I do like the option for the software to tell me if there are errors and then if I want them fixed, I tell it to fix, but I don't have to. I also like that when I am working on 7's (for example) all of the sevens on the board are highlighted and all of the 7 pencil marks are also highlighted. This adds another level of testing for accuracy and guessing.

What I really like about It is that it helps a great deal in learning to play Sudoku correctly. There is a very good tutorial included.  I have only played the free game so far, but I am going to buy the paid version right now!! You should get this if you want to learn how to play the correct way, instead of guessing sometimes.  It is also pretty easy to understand. I have tried many of the Sudoku games out there, but this is by far the best!!!

I've been playing Astraware Sudoku (on another platform) for years, and on the highest difficulty levels, always got to a point where I guessed which number an open pair represented with pencilmarks, backtracking if I picked the wrong number.  With Enjoy, I'm using the hints to learn how to use logic tricks instead of guesswork.

I like finding out how I did after playing the game and this one tells you your percentile rank compared to others who played that same game, without using hints or if you used hints. I have played many electronic versions of Sudoku over the years but this is the best one there is.

I review here Enjoy Sudoku (ES) for the KF.Enjoy Sudoku is one of the best board-type game applications I've ever seen, across all forms of games, across several platforms.The display is beautiful. I typically play with my KF in portrait position. I've tried landscape; it works perfectly, but it's just not to my taste. The highlighting of completed row/box is useful. Highlighting "all number N used" is extremely helpful, but having the display flash in different colors takes a bit of getting used to.The user controls are OK:- Entering choices using the box-first approach is intuitive. Entering number-first-then-box is claimed to be faster, but again, it takes some getting used to. (Because of the highlighting feature, I've not been able to get used to it because of the way the colors change back and forth.)- The undo/back-track command is really great. I haven't yet found how deep the undo stack is, but I've exercised it pretty well, I think.- I've used the rotate/mirror commands only once, but the change of viewpoint enabled me to finish a "fiendish" (toughest level) puzzle. Bravo.- I have yet to figure out what other command buttons do - from my perspective, ES behaves just a tad strangely when some buttons are pressed. I suppose I should read the manual, but a perfect app is written so all controls are intuitive.A truly strong point of ES is the range of available daily games: there are FOURTEEN levels, ranging from trivial to, well, really really (near impossibly) hard. Winner, winner, chicken dinner. There is a slight discontinuity in difficulty: the game takes a big jump somewhere around "moderate" or "intricate." I can live with that. Starting over doesn't impact time-to-complete scoring (I'm divided on this one).At the end of a game, you get some feedback with a rough percentile chart. Sorta informative. It would be nicer if there was an absolute ranking; "User_name is 483 of 10 zillion" could be rewarding to players.I really recommend this app to KF owners.

Not because it's perfect - the resolution on my XOOM could be higher and the game is not as responsive to tilting the tablet as it should be - but because I just love playing it. It's got a definite retro, arcade feeling and, unlike something that you could have played back in the late 80's/early 90's, it responds to your gadget's accelerometer. And, with unlimited ammo, missiles and lots more surprises, it's just plain, no apologies fun.I got mine as the free Amazon 'app of the day' but it's worth the admission price from anyone looking for a simple but fun arcade game.P.S. - the game allows for 'keyboard' controls and I was in fact able to play it off a bluetooth keyboard paired with my tablet but why would anyone want to do that? It's easier to score because you're a lot more accurate but it's not as much fun as the tilting or accelerometer mode.

Boasting superior graphics and sound always attracts my attention, so I snatched up this title as soon as I could.On my little Epic, I was able to kick in all the eye candy Overkill offered and still maintain over 50 frames per second.  Everything was very smooth, not a single glitch or hiccup.  I even enabled the fast load option and didn't encounter an issue.  Everything was nicely detailed and crystal clear.  Very, very nice.  On the gTablet, things didn't fare so well.  Averaging 45 frames per second, everything did work, and worked just as smoothly as it did on the Epic, but the graphics were *so* not superior.  They are all fuzzy and lacking detail.  I toggled every option in every combination possible and still they barely entered medicore range. Sorry guys, try again.  As for the sound, yeah, it's pretty good.  Clear sound effects and a good background soundtrack.On both my devices, the accelerometer control was dead on perfect.  I like that Overkill recalibrates at the beginning of each level, adjusting itself to how you're holding the device at the time.  This allows you to to play the game in pretty much any position you want.  In game recalibration is also there, to give you a chance to fix things up if they aren't to your liking.  Doing some good thinking, Overkill's dev also put in sensitivity adjustment, which will allow the game to be adjusted to the device and gamer's preferred style of play.  Keyboard/touchscreen controls worked just as well, with nary a missed movement or sluggish response.  Sorry, I don't own a Zeemote, so I was unable to test this function.The game itself is what I would consider a complete title.  Besides running through a storylined campaign mode, there is is a test mode, quick mission mode, and survival mode, all of which extend the replay level.  Multiple difficulty levels can be played, with the difficulty level factored into your score.  The computer AI's lines are only slightly cheesy, and often humorous.  As is typical with games of this genre, weapons upgrades are available and new weapon types appear at different parts of the games.  A complete help section is built in, with links back to the dev's site for yet more information.  Gameplay is action packed, with no laggy spots.  The one thing I don't particularly care for, besides the less than stellar graphics on the tablet, is the use of the screen real estate.  In general, I think all the objects are too big, giving the gameplay a cramped feeling.With all that praise, why only three stars?  Simple - if you're going to make a lot of hoopla about the graphics and don't deliver, that's a double negative for me.  Get that fixed up, and it's a 4-5 star title.I hope you found this review helpful, and if not, feel free to leave comments/question

The controls are pretty responsive. I normally don't like games where the controls are handled by the accelerometer, but I think I liked this one because it auto-shoots so that is one less thumb being constantly on the screen.

The controls petty much killed it for me, though: no matter what you do, the ship lags behind where you tell it to go, and that means you don't shoot the targets, and you eat the incoming bullets.Trusting the life of my little ship and its crew to the accelerometer is as bad an idea as one would expect, but the only other option is to cloak your ship with your finger: an act that does little to hide you from the enemies, but does a fair job of obscuring your view, making this difficult and annoying to play. And at the end of the day, those at not words to describe a game that will keep me coming back for more. Which is sad, because it has everything else going for it.

I love side scrollers and space shooters and the graphics are very nice.  But,  I find the controls completely unplayable.  The touch controls lag terribly and then inexplicably my ship starts moving wildly from top to bottom while my finger is still in the middle smashing into everything until Game Over.  If they fix the controls,  this might be a great game.

It reminds me of some classic arcade games (can't think of their names off the top of my head) and has some cool modern elements to it.  It is challenging, and not just because the controls are tough.  It takes a little while to figure out what is going on in the game, but the learning curve isn't too steep.  They give you three control options.  First is tiling the screen to use the accelerometer to control the ship.  This is extremely difficult, though novel, and might be a good way to do it if you're used to it.  The second way is by using the touchscreen, which is a little finicky, and can be challenging when your fingers are in the way of your view, but they worked the best for me.  The third is to use some sort of controller (Wii-mote maybe?) which would probably be ideal, but I haven't gotten around to trying that yet.  I knocked a point off for the controls, otherwise would be perfect to me.  Plays well on my Motorola Atrix.

I generally don&apos;t like motion control but I gave it a fair shot before switching to the option where you control the ship movement with your finger. That was disastrous. For one thing, you can&apos;t see the ship because your finger completely covers it. That wouldn&apos;t be too horrible, but the nail in the coffin was very poor responsiveness in this mode. \nToo bad, really. I think they did a fine job making a great looking side scrolling space shooter, but ultimately if you&apos;re like me, you won&apos;t like using motion control in this format. \n2. 5 stars

I couldn&apos;t play properly with the accelerometer, it calibrates while the game loads up so I&apos;m assuming it got f&apos;d up somewhere along the way. No big deal, I changed the settings to use the touchscreen to control the ship. It seemed to work alright at first, but it progressively got worse as the game went on. With all the hassles of trying to simply play the game, I just couldn&apos;t enjoy it.

Decent graphics, several game modes, and challenging gameplay make for a fun game.I noticed in the description it said it was redesigned to support tablets, so I expected HD graphics or improved controls or something, I did not see any optimization on my Transformer running Honeycomb 3.2, the 3.2 software sizes the game to fill the screen resulting in less resolution and stretched graphics for apps that aren't optimized for tablets. This appeared to be the case with this game.So the look wasn't optimized, next to check controls.Upon attempting to play the game using the acceleometer, I found that it was wanting me to control it as though it were in portrait mode but was in landscape, thereby making it unplayable using that method. Next I used screen control method with better results but found the controls using this method difficult although playable on a 10.1 inch screen. So, unless I'm missing another tablet version of this game, it definitely isn't optimized and is barely playable at least on Asus Transformers. As it is only "redesigned to support" tablets and only optimized for the Galaxy  Tab (really, why only that one?), I guess I couldn't expect too much, but most games are playable with 3.2, I don't know how the controls could get messed up so much, but I digress.So bottom line, this was great on my Thunderbolt, ran perfectly, but for a supposedly "tablet supported" game it failed badly on my Transformer, so if that's all you have to use apps on, I'd skip this for now.Anyhow, as long as you aren't buying this for your Transformer it's a good game, at $2 it's higher than most, and I'm not sure I'd pay more than a buck, but it is a good game overall and if you like Defender type games you'll like this.Feel free to comment but know that Amazon will not allow me to reply. Long story, but basically, if I were you I wouldn't reply to any of the troll reviews or correct others misconceptions, Amazon will ban you for criticising others reviews. Its a lifetime ban so there you go.

I enjoy word games, etc and this is a different way to use your brain to come up with words. I told my aunt about it and she loves Word Collapse as well.  Granted it is not the hardest or most challenging word game but it is most definately a different word game to play. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys word games and does not mind having one that is not difficult when you just need to play something to clear your mind.

This app has almost no permissions, which is GREAT.  So what reason it has to be stationed on the internal storage is a mystery.  It's not a critical utility app that may require it to load on the boot, nor does it contain a widget.... so WHY?  Why ruin an otherwise very decent, low-permissions app with that horrible oversight?  And I'm very happy to not see social networking components like Feint in the app, but is there any good reason not to at least keep internal scoring and add a permission to write to the SD for that purpose?  I'm shaking my head on why this developer wouldn't do these two simple things to make the app more valuable.  The gameplay was great.  I had no problems with boredom and the like.  I don't need to be entertained by little birds perched on wire that fly away when you select a letter.  This app is clearly for adults looking for content rather than primarily "graphic bling."  One other suggestion:  Lose the italics.  Word game people who like to play for extended periods of time of more than 10 minutes will begin to find the italic print irritating and not as easy for the eyes to adjust to.If the italics are removed, internal scoring is added, and it gets moved to the external SD, I'll be back to happily change this rating to a 5-star one.  Til then, I have to chalk its tire and tell it to move along, with a 1-star citation for parking itself on my phone's No Parking Zone.

It is very simple to learn and you can easily end up spending hours challenging yourself to flex your vocabulary "muscles".The app takes up less than 1 MB of space on my Kindle Fire (which doesn't have or need a SD card) so I didn't lower my rating becasue of the size of the game.I would give it 5 stars except for the lack of a multiple player mode.  I think it would be even more fun if you could have the added challenge of an opponent.  Maybe they will add that option to the game, but in the meantime it is worth a try if you are at all fond of word-related games.  A very good FAOTD choice.

I also like that it has three modes of playing so if you get tired of one you just change over.

It wouldn't let me spell the word cytoplasm, and a few others. I don't know about you but I get frustrated when I'm playing a game where you have to get rid of as many letters as possible and it just won't let you. Sorry but I'm going to go ahead and uninstall because this is more frustrating than fun.

Each game is scored, but high scores aren't saved anywhere. Also, unlike other word games, exiting the app ends the current game, rather than pausing it for later. That is my biggest concern. I like to go in and out of games over the course of days.As it is, it's ok for free. I wouldn't pay full price until they updated this app with some basic features.

As each bubble is hit (with a satisfying POP!) it grows a size until finally it bursts, sending a blast to the nearest horizontal and vertical bubbles, which in turn causes them to grow. You are given a limited number hits, but as the bubbles burst they will do some of the popping for you.The trick is to figure out which bubbles to hit to cause a chain reaction of bubble popping splendor!A good time waster. You can solve bubble grid puzzles or play arcade mode to either get a high score or just to zone out on the pop pop popping.Minus one star simply because it can get dull doing nearly the same thing over and over, with no new challenges or rewards in higher levels.

I like when games have more strategy, rather than just randomly placing the blaster and then seeing what happens. But the popping noise is really cool!

Despite it's white-on-white upper case 'T' icon that's difficult to see here, it's a worthy consideration when you need to take a word search a bit deeper.Granted that the Kindle Fire devices have a decent way to check the spelling for the words that you may enter, in its native form you have no way of looking for that similar, alternative word that might fit your needs a bit better. As a reference work for basic needs in grouping words together according to similarity of meaning, and containing synonyms and often antonyms, this is an app that works well.At less than 180KB, it's a fast download, and once installed, you'll find its interface easy to use and quite intuitive. It also keeps a history of the words that you've looked up.TheThesaurusapp for the original Kindle Fire or the Kindle Fire HD series is recommended for wordsmiths of all ages, and the price is quite reasonable for all it does.10/16/2012; Updated 1/5/2013

I was worried after reading some of the other reviews, but I downloaded it anyway and I'm extremely impressed. I had an important phone interview for a homework assignment and I wanted to make sure that I wouldn't forget anything that was said. This app recorded the entire 20 minute conversation and auto-emailed me a copy of the audio recording. I highly recommend changing the audio format in settings to MPEG-4 and choosing the auto upload to your Gmail account. I will definitely pay for the full version once the trial time expires. 5 stars all the way!

It is hard enough to exercise your brain, but not so difficult that you have spend hours on each game.  (My best time is 4 minutes and my average time is 11 minutes, so this is a game that you can play while waiting a few minutes for a dr. appt, or while a passenger in a car.)  If you don't exit out of the game, your game in progress will still be there the next time you open it.  I just press the button that brings me back to my phone's home page if I need to stop the game and do something else and then the game is waiting for me the next time I open the game.  I also have the free solitaire and free cell games from Odesys.  I like them too and they also have a setting for playing only solvable games.

It was about 2 weeks later when I was putting up a shelf and my actual level was not in the tool box or anywhere else I looked. Then I remembered I had this app and grabbed my Kindle, stood it on its side on top of the shelf, made the needed adjustment and secured it to the wall. Later that day when I finally came across my level, I double checked to see how accurate it turned out and it couldn't have been any more level than it was. I am impressed and although it may only come in handy once in a great while, it still is a very useful app.

I happen to like Honeycomb's standard interface more than dxTop's but that's a matter of taste. Objectively, the scope of this app - take near-complete control of my desktop (and yes, it comes with custom icons and themes) - was enough of a concern for me to remove it shortly after installation. I asked myself how other, more modest add-ons would perform while dxTop was in charge and I find the answer quickly. "Application Folder Pro", my favorite folder organizer was unusable under the new management. Others apps and widgets may be preempted but that's as far as my investigation went.If accepted as the alternative interface, the app is deep and complex enough to demand quite a substantial time investment but that would be okay if the rewards justified the effort. In my case (XOOM, Honeycomb) they don't. I wasn't able to justify allowing a "vendor's" app to make phone calls on my behalf without me knowing it, just to mention one of the more intrusive rights you grant the app as you install it. And, on a more parochial note, dxTop was stuck in 'portrait' on my XOOM. There may be some setup option that might change that to 'auto-rotate' but I removed dxTop before I found it.For 'positives', this does appear to be a well-thought, well-designed overlay but it's a radical departure from Android's way of interacting with the end-user so one of the first questions that popped into my mind was: if they believe that Android's interface deserves to be so completely wiped out, why not produce their own mobile OS? Seriously.In the Android world what I need and in fact I welcome at this time is 'helpers' such as 'App Folder Pro', not a new boss. dxTop tries to make itself the boss and I have not use for that.

Once that completes, it says Install Failed! I have not found a way to contact the developer to get help and if this is not fixed SOON I will be finding something else!

Works well, does what it should etc.But, it offers no options or customization that aren't in a few free Home alternative (not listed here for etiquette, but you can find them by searching the market).If you don't have access to the standard Android Market, I can see this being a viable option for you; otherwise, just go with a free one. :-\

Well, not quite.I always go through the reviews before installing. But I always download because I want to be ready to pounce. Even despite the reviews I was like, &quot;Huh, maybe it will still work.&quot;  My dissapointment set in when I went to install it and the permissions were far more reaching than the capabilities of not only the descriptions but the reviews.This app wants to read my messages? It wants to read my system log? Why? It wants unintrusive access to everything on my phone which, if it's replacing the Droid OS, I understand BUT when I look at the reviews and the full capabilities of the app it makes me extremely nervous. It's just this side of jailbreaking my phone as it is, no reason to invite trouble where it isn't needed.

That app was rated well, as there is, arguably, a use for it and the app was intuitive and ran well.  This app replaces something that doesn't need replacing.  Whether you run Froyo or Gingerbread, either will be faster and smoother than this offering.  I can see limited appeal for those who feel the need to customize and tweak and recustomize their devices, but I have better things to do with my time than &quot;fix&quot; what isn't broken and replace it with something that isn't quite as good.

It tries and fails to import your home screens that you already have so you don't have to do much customisation.  It crashes Home Switcher. It does support scrolling widgets, but that is not nearly redeeming enough. Launcherpro or ADW are far better free alternatives.

Not bad but inconvenient, next best thing to rooting your phone I guess though.

I'm just saying that I expect more from a paid app than what can be gotten from a free app.

Love these, and customizing was the whole reason for leaving the iPhone behind.  I've tried out lots of them, ADW, Launcher Pro, VTL, and more, settling in on Go Launcher EX for my phone and tablet. Along comes dxTop Pro, and I'm ready to give it a go.Comparing against my previous experience, dxTop Pro isn't too shabby.  It has lots of customization built in, including an iPhone-like lock screen replacement.  There are a fair number of themes for it, but many will cost you and there aren't nearly as many as there are for other launchers.  On both devices, the performance felt laggy, not as snappy as what I'm used to.  Flipping between screens rapidly, say from all the way left to all the way right, invariably stalled and required a second swipe to get to the last screen.  Looking that the resources being used, dxTop Pro eats up a good bit more than Go Launcher EX (22-30MB vs 17-21MB). The included screen capture is a nice idea, but had a tendency to stick and shoot multiple shots.  The captured images didn't include the wallpaper, which is a bummer.  Sadly, the screen capture only worked outside of applications.  The folder setup is depreciated from stock, in that you have to manually put items into the folders one at a time.  On the plus side, you can change the folder icon to whatever you like, including photos.To sum it all up, dxTop has a bunch of cool little features but they come at a price.  Perhaps as it matures it will get better. I'll hang onto it for a bit but have a feeling I'll be back to Go Launcher EX within a week or two.I hope you found this review helpful, and if not, feel free to leave comments/questions

I will probably uninstall since its too difficult to get use to. I read the reviews first and still like to try it my self, however I got to agree with what most are saying about it. Nothing special and its ugly. I tried to like it.

With this app though, I think more personal preference was put into the design and layout, rather than thought about what others would enjoy or find useful.Then again it could just be me.  I couldn't get used to the home screen diamond navigation or the quick access buttons.  I found them all rather clunky and hard to use.  The list of apps organized into running, services, recent waas nice.Overall the whole interface ran slower that the default one, and made the choice to uninstall a no brainer.  Better luck next time.

IMHO this update makes this program unnecessary. I spent hours working to get the dxTop close to what I already had with the Android OS and the dxTop was still inferior. To make matters worse is that a few hours later, the dxTop lost my settings, so I would have had to do it all over again. I uninstalled it and am quite happy to be using the Android homepage once again. I am glad that I got it free or I would have been upset. Perhaps a more seasoned pro could make it work, but for me, no thanks.

I downloaded it and installed and there was no choice in turning it on or off, it just starts up. then not liking that fact I tried to uninstall it and it wasn't in my app list. might be a great app but I just didn't like the design or functionality of it.

But I thought I'd give this one a fair go to see if it was worth considering. If you are tired of your stock home screen then, yes, I think you should give this a look. It seems zippy and allows you a little more customization than some stock home screens allow. The biggest thing that irked me as that it replaced how I turn on my phone (the launch screen, is it called?). It completely replaced it and didn't ask me if it was okay first. Worst yet, I dug around the options and could not figure out how to turn my old screen back on. It was about this time that I gave up on it. Otherwise, I mostly liked what I saw and liked that it offered a lot of options (just not the one I wanted).Worth considering, especially today while it is free, but it wasn't up to LauncherPro status to me.

By default it isn't the most beautiful, but you can customize it to death.What I do like:- apps sorted alphabetically in a clear fashion- lots of themes- 5 way switching between homescreens,  would work nice with 5 screensWhat I don't care about:- the recent apps drawer with services and running apps- 5 homescreen. I don't need so many. So it kind of makes the 5 way switching useless- a gazillion themes.  It should look great by defaultWhat I dislike:- it's a lot more sluggish than go launcher ex or the default touching on my phone- themes are pricey. I don't want to pay more for a theme than for the app.- it looks low-def on my screen. And the ui has many inconsistent quality things.- lack of included widgets,  go launcher has great widgets

Even when switching back to ADW, there are huge unmanageable delays in everything I try to do.

I had always just had the default interface and felt it was fine, but my brother does a lot of customizing with his myTouch 4G, so I thought, &quot;Eh, why not try it out?&quot; Never again will I try to change the home layout.

This is a very good home replacement app. I've used every alternative out there and while this is definitely not the best it's nowhere near the worst. Just because it's different and you don't know how to use it doesn't mean it's a bad app.  There's no way I'd pay anything for this app, not with GO being free and a much better option, but for free dxTop certainly deserves a download. My advice, ignore the bad reviews and try it yourself. It's free for f's sake!And to the reviewer below me, no, this app did not break your phone. If you believe that is even possible you need to immediately post your EVO on craigslist and go buy an iPhone.

The description touts the diamond pattern layout of the windows, and that is the greatest thing this app brings to the table, which I have not seen in any other launcher so far. Makes you wonder why no one else came up with the idea to lay out your screens to minimize swipe after swipe to get to what you're looking for.Unfortunately, that's also the only great thing I see here. The app drawer appears forgotten, lacking the ability to drag and sort, or create folders to group apps in. (GoLauncher does this for free, btw) The interface has a little sluggishness to it, which never helps. It runs okay on my Thunderbolt (rooted and running DasBAMF 1.8.6 Remix), and looks kindof like crap on my Galaxy Tab 10.1 (stock), (but so far, everything else does too, so no love lost here).Then there is the killer, which took this from a four star app to three, and I even considered two because this was the reason I uninstalled: when my phone reboots I get a message several times telling me that Amazon AppStore is no longer installed. I assume this nuisance alert appears because some Amazon service is still starting up, but why should my app launcher care what market/store I have installed? Must have something to do with licensing, but I think this is as unnecessary as it is annoying. Just open my apps and display my widgets, and don't tell me what needs to be installed, outside of what installed with your launcher.

I personally care for the look of the Gingerbread setup better, but this app has potential. Now though, it's clunky and limited. I'm not a fan. Maybe after an update it'll improve.

Also I gave this link to a friend of mine with an atrix, which has duel cores and a bigger active memory base, he says it also slows down his entire device. so clearly they need to do some heavy optimization.The Lock screen mimic's the iPhone lock screen, which again is very slow to response and feels clunky and slow to respondThe one touch application menu in the center is a pretty slick idea.The addition of instant access to your Text messaging program is pretty cool, but it' not really setup for customizationIt has potential but it has a hell of a long way to go to get there.I'm giving this two stars because it has possibilities and some rather interesting ideas, nothing terrible innovative or remarkable. It just needs work.

Very smooth and the widgets and look screen are a nice touch.Overall very impressed.I have tried many home replacements including but not limited too ADW ex, Launcher Pro, Go Launcher, Pandahome, Launcher 7, Mr. Home, Regina, aHome, etc ... Well... you should get the picture. All of the have some things that make them unique and none of them are perfect. dxTop pro isn't over the top with settings and customizations but it is unique and works very well.ADW ex is my favorite and go to launcher but dxTop Pro will definitely get it's use.Side note: Wake up Amazon! Allowing all of these stupid review is ruining your market. I can't imagine too many more developers are going to want to take a chance on faulty review scores because the stupid person downloading a FREE app didn't get the game they thought they deserved. Just another way we see how entitlements are ruining are society!

I also like to point out that you can resize your calender or any other widgets on the wall. The way it organized my app is pretty cool but all the negatives things kind of made me want to uninstall the app.

I like the layout and the varied custimization. Take time to see what it offers and how tidy yet gorgeous it makes your home pages and app drawers.

I did however delete it off my phone since I liked the stock one just as much.  This app does a good job of adding choices to the android community.  The first minute of use seemed lagy, but then it took off fine.

I've looked around the market and online at current themes and icon packs but in the end I'll stick with the stock HTC Sense. Maybe once I find an icon pack that replaces everything I have on my home screens, I might try this again.

This replacement UI really slowed down my Droid X.After uninstalling my phone also did a random reboot. Reminded me of a dog getting out of water and shaking to get the remnants off.

I can get to my widgets and every other app easily. I may download and try one of the themes but they are $1.99 each  andi have not found the&quot;perfect&quot; one yet.I worried that I would lose my application folders but they are all there and working..  I gave this app 4 stars because it delivers what it says it does.

The police/fire feed for the county where 90% of my daily commuting takes place provides me valuable warning on road problems that traffic reporters would be telling me about far too late...if at all.Easy to use; search by name, genre or location, or search for any audio within a radius near you. No stability issues running on an anHTC Evo 4gVery few differences between this and thepaidversion. Paid version drops ads, and adds a pause/play button that is persistent between sessions (and you can run the free and paid version at the same time to follow two programming sources).

Its not something I use that often or would see myself using on a regular basis. I basically re-download it when I see a lot of firetrucks or police in my area and want to hear whats going on.

It gets you police radio conversation (even comes with a 10-codes translator file). It lets you:- set alerts based no the number of people listening to a specific scanner- mark your own favorites- finds stations 'near you' based on your location- has a top-50 list based on the number of listeners- lets you browse by area (in 15 countries), genre and source- shows 'new additions'- at least on a tablet's large screen the ads are small and unobtrusiveOn my XOOM (Android 3.2) I am able to continue to listen to the police talk while running other tasks such as browsing the Web or writing emails.Good work.

Only caveat is that all areas are not yet covered so if there's not an audio feed for your area this would be wasted to you.

Never realized how busy chicago police are till I listened to a little while of their feed. One complaint I read about on the google market is that there are limited feeds outside major cities and very few outside the united states, since many scanners are encrypted. Very well made app and volunteers run the feeds.

Now they are trunked and newer scanners are expensive. Then I got a HTC Hero and this app and got the Scanner pro for free when they offered it. You can use it anywhere, anytime. I love both of them, free and pro and you can run them at the same time. If it is busy, it can by messy listening tho, :)But I love everything it does and hope it will do more. I would love to volunteer. Would love WSP too. A must have app for scanner lovers! Never had any problems with the actual app either, lots of work went into it.

It runs for hours with no one saying anything.  Does not seem to be a good method to tell them the audio is not working other than clicking &#34;no audio&#34;.  Volume seems to have only one level; can't turn it up.  Enjoy using it if there was some audio to listen to.

I pick up police, fire, EMS, railroads.....from my area and from several different states as well. And the reception is super clear. I bought a scanner for a few hundred dollars last year and returned it - it was terrible. But this free app on my Kindle Fire picks up everything and all I have to do is type in a city name or county! Easy, fun and free. No trouble with installing it or using it at all.I highly recommend it.

It picks up my local police station and you can't believe some of the stuff that goes on around town. The best time to listen to it is on weekends or holidays. It is very entertaining. Sometimes you just can't stop listening. Very addicting. There are complaints about it running down battery quickly, but I use this app on my kindle fire and it doesn't seem to use any more battery than any other open app. The other nice thing is that you can run this program in the background and still play other games or surf the Internet. I strongly urge you to give this app a try!

Listening to police scanners is not for everyone I'm sure but my dad and I used to sit outside and listen to one on hot summer nights when I was a kid and I've been hooked ever since. It's probably a guy thing but I can imagine if a girl spent a bunch of summer nights listening to one with her dad  she may still enjoy it once in awhile. You can't beat the price - it's free. It's easy to use. I recommend it.

I have it on my Kindle Fire & other than no GPS, which would have made it even more useful, it still works great. Recommend to get this app since you got here to read reviews, it interests you as it did me, and you will like it.

This app allows me to listen to these systems (one at a time), so it's nice not to have to purchase a $400 scanner just to add one department.

All of the local municipal and state frequencies in my area are lumped into one single monitor frequency in my area though. I thought I would try this app just to see how well it works and it does. I have both a base station scanner in my house and a hand held scanner for mobile use when I go on trips but i'll bet they haven't been turned on more than ten or fifteen times in the years that I've had them. Listening to scanner calls as a steady diet is somewhat distracting to me. As a point of reference I was a licensed ham radio operator and CB radio operator. I never put my mobile transceiver in my car at all any more nor turn on my base station radio transceiver anymore either. I don't think my base station transceiver's antenna coaxial cable is even hooked up to the radio anymore as well. For you scanner junkies out there the Scanner Radio app will work just fine on your tablet or android phone and you can listen to scanner calls to your heart's content. One of my best friends is a consummate scanner monitor listener and has his scanners running all of his waking hours at home. In any event, happy listening on the Scanner Monitor app to the rest of you.

Shortly after downloading it, I used it, and even shorter after that, I deleted it. It is a very heavy program that once downloaded, starts sending you constant spam from their contributors.

I know what is going on and where the troubled spots are and when. When I hear of breaking national news I can look for a frequency in the area effected and can listen to events as they happen. I had an old style scanner when my children were teens and loved hearing the goings on. Now scanners have gone high tech and are available over your computer, Kindle, and even smartphones.

I guess that is really great!!  I waited and in an hour there were 2 contacts between the dispatcher and a patrol officer.  One about a lost dog and another about some trash.  Each was about 10 seconds.  It did kind of startle me when I heard it.  I thought it best just to remove it.  You may live in a city that has an interesting climate or you are a criminal and want to know when they are coming to your door but that is not me.  Try it you may need it or just enjoy hearing what happening!

The people rating it 1 star need to read.The scanner itself works great. It uses an online provider to get its data, which receives its data from individual enthusiasts.It is great to use for killing the time or listening to local events. It may be a data hog but there isn't really an easy way around it from a code point of view. Nonetheless, this application is worth the increased data use. If you have a wifi connection of unlimited data like myself there really is no reason to avoid downloading this application.

More urban areas if you search have more going on and better decriptions, more rural, obviously not as much going on, but sometimes the radios sound worse etc.  but great thing to have if u like to know whats going on.

I took it off because I don't know if it might be illegal in this state as most everything probably is here. Have no use for it anyway. It works and can be adjusted to many different areas at least where I am located. I didn't know so many people were jabbering on the radio so much. I heard Fire, Police and a lot of unidentifiable jabber talk going on even late in the night. An old Ham or CB operator that knew the lingo would enjoy this thing. A friend of mine works in the Fire Department so I will have to find out if I can have this without cops going goofy on me somehow for some reason. Might be useful in an emergency?

It's ok, we use it to listen to the local police and NYCPD.

Hey everybody want to know what police and firefighters are up to? Then you need scanner radio free at the App store. This app works with the help of wi-fi the thing that most of the world depends on. If you want to know what is going on near you, you can search on the search selection and type in your state, country, city, or zip code and all you have to do is choose one out of the many options that pop up. This app has no lag and will keep you on alert so you know where the bad boys are. So what are you waiting for? The world to end. I don't think so. Its time to get this app because it has your name on it saying download me. Chill out and relax with scanner radio.

A lot of times when I have people over I'll put this app on in the background and we'll just socialize or have some drinks and every once in a while we hear some action that we get into. It's really cool as well that you can search the world for a city's radio to listen to. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is beucase on the free version, there are certain featuers that are lacking. i.e. you can't use the &#34;play/pause/stop&#34; button at the top of the screen unless you pay for it but you can still hit the back button and do the same thing if you want it to stop. :)

Since free wifi is available in many places, it was helpful for the weather radio.  Do keep in mind that if you are serious about accessing weather radio, it probably best to buy one for that specific purpose.  Wifi is pretty dicey in emergency situations.

It's ok I guess, it really just depends on where you live and what you are looking to hear on this app.  I would listen in to be nosy and see what kind of 'action' was going on around the city; sometimes I will check out NYC or Chicago or whatever...also, we had some wildfires close to town this summer and I would listen in on the fire dept. channel at times to see if I heard anything the news wasn't putting out.  Many times when the channels get busy they overlap and it's hard to understand.  I have downloaded this on my Kindle and on my Samsung Blaze...both worked fine.  Cheap entertainment app. :)

This is one of those apps that has its place for all of us that wish we were part of the action, but glad we're not.  After 25+ years in law enforcement, and have owned several scanners in my time, and although I don't currently own the latest in a digital spread spectrum top of the line scanner.  I still have a digital scanner in my pocket thanks to scanner radioYa gotta love those guys and gals who of there own free will take the time to set up there own scanners and allow those of us that want to listen can listen.  I would hazard a guess that most of us have a favorite or two or three set frequencies if you will, well, with this app, you can set up your favorites list and you can just pick and chose which one you want to listen to for the first hour or two.  Or maybe one of your favorites is quiet tonight, you take a chance and see whats going on in the land down under, yep, we can listen to the brave men and women in uniform in Australia.  While its no hand held scanner that you can set up, program, have an antenna on the roof of your home and all, bt this isn't a bad substitute, try it, couldn't hurt, you may just be the next action junkie.  Have fun with this, don't become an ambulance chaser, you may wind up being the topic of discussion for that evening, not sayin, just sayin, be smart and be safe, enjoy the app for what it is.

Kudos to the designer and to the volunteers who lend their scanners to provide this app.  The coverage of local police, fire and EMT service seems excellent, and the small ads are not too intrusive.  The site is very easy to navigate and a list of police codes is included.  There is even an archive if you want to review prior dates, but it requires a paid subscription so I haven't checked it out.  I find it hard to tear myself away from the live police chatter, even though it's usually quite routine.  Update 4-27-13 -- The alerts accurately tell you when there are more listeners than usual in a certain area.  Today I listened in on Australia loud and clear.  I'm impressed!

I like the GPS settings that find the broadcasts around you, and the alert function is kinda cool, if a set amount of people tune into a police band it will alert you, theory is if 100 people are listening at once something exciting is probably going on.  The feeds this app use are actually available to listen to for free online, but it is a cool user interface for your smart phone.

In my home area we've had several major fires this summer, and it's helpful to know what's going on in real time. On a trip, we picked up info about a fire in the Sierras near where we were heading. Recommend getting this app for that time you really really need to know about an emergency situation near you.

The only downfall for me personally is there is no scanners in my direct area I can listen to. I do still turn it on from time to time for entertainment/background noise but woudl definitely be more fun if local scanners were included in it. I've had it for quite awhile too and none in my area have been added to the app. It does have a search bar and you can search for any department/area/city....I'd recommend it, just not if you're looking for your city and if you live in the middle of no where!

With almost all major city going to Digital Trunk since9/11 this app will save you between $350-500. As long as you have High-Speed interenet your all set. The only draw-back is if your in an area with no High-Speed internet capability. Which for most people doesn't apply. I'd highly recommend this App.

I only offers a selective group of frequencies, and they are not in my city! It's OK for what it is, and might be fun to listen to is you want to learn some of the radio codes used by law enforcement, but it doesnt replace a real scanner that can be programmed to your liking.

This app is working just right for that.  I don't monitor local scanners for all police and emergency activity on a regular basis so I can't speak to that but I think it would be quite suitable.  Update - due to a large event in my area last weekend, I used the local scanner feeds and it was excellent - easy to locate what I wanted and switch between the main police and EMS feeds!  Audio was great, taking into account that scanner audio can be difficult.  Handy pop up of codes, too.

I needed a pdf reader for various work documents, and thought having only one app would just be convenient.  As a reader, yes it performs perfectly.

It crashes constantly, even when I am not using it.Not only is the instability pathetic, but that is exacerbated by the fact that there is no option to tell this dumb thing I don't want it to constantly run (and crash, apparently) in the background. How hard would it be to have an option for that?It makes no effort to keep track of your actual reading progress.  It remembers the last page viewed, which is insufficient because jumping to the index or end notes to check something results in the Kindle app assuming that to be your new current reading progress. Unless you manually bookmarked the page every time, progress is lost. It would be incredibly simple to have a default bookmark which keeps track of the highest page you actually flipped to in 1-page increments, rather than merely the last page displayed.It does let you change the text size and background color, which is worth a couple stars.

A387VI3T9N1DDF,B004DLPXAO,1.32749562172,0.503526504942,0.0279465370595,0.000607533414338,0.587,0.869565217391,TRUTHFUL,It does the job, sort of.  But for being the only ebook reader app for the most popular source of ebooks--namely, Amazon--it is very sadly lacking in features.  Just compare to ebook readers like Moon+ or Mantano and Android, or even ebook readers on obsolete platforms like Plucker for PalmOS (which I was a developer for).My comments are skewed by the fact that I am a scholar in the humanities, and so my needs are for study rather than just linear reading.Here are some specifics:1. The search is unacceptably slow.  For instance, to search my approximately 6mb ebook, it took six minutes on my Archos 43.  Compare that to 22 seconds with Moon+, or about 50 seconds with Plucker on PalmOS on a much slower device (200MHz versus 1000MHz).  Search is the main advantage of electronic texts for serious students of the texts.  Without a decent speed search, there is little advantage except convenience.  And it would be good to have some more search options (phrase, word, boolean, etc.).2. The subpixel font rendering assumes horizontal RGB striping.  This means that the subpixel algorithm fails, producing faint color shadows near letters, in all orientations other than one (on my Archos 43, it works in portrait, but fails in others;  on my wife's Kindle Fire, it works in landscape, but fails in others).  It's not such a big deal on my Archos 43, as the pixels on it are so small.  This is easy to fix: just turn off subpixel rendering and replace it with grayscale antialiasing, or add an option to do that.  And I bet it works badly in all orientations on OLED devices that don't use uniform RGB stripes at all.  (The best would be to auto-detect based on orientation and screen type.  But I don't know if Android includes an API for getting RGB striping information.  On the Kindle Fire's version of the app, though, you could just go on orientation, since you know which way the RGB is striped there.)  Subpixel rendering for the wrong orientation is worse than grayscale rendering.3. More color options, please.  It would take only a few minutes for the developer to add a bunch more color options.  (I know, because I'm a developer for a PDF viewer for Android.)  For instance, green on black is great for reading at night.  Red on black is essential if you want to preserve night vision.  Black on sepia is nicer than brown on sepia.  And why not just let the user customize it?4. I wish the viewer would optionally let you move through the text by scrolling rather than paging.  Paging isn't quite so good for complex scholarly texts, as it's harder to think about a sentence or paragraph that is broken across screens.  Much easier if you can just scroll it so the text you're thinking about fits on one screen.5. There should be an option to eliminate all margins (on a small screen device, one doesn't need more than about two pixels).  The tightest margin setting still has too much margin.6. Optionally, make the main screen be just a list of titles, like on eink Kindles.  Lists with book cover thumbnails make sense only for small collections of books, and presumably you'd like users to have large connections. :-)7. I can't find a way to categorize books.  There should be one.What do I like?- stability- easy downloads- correct formatting- number of books available

It was so much easier than dragging my large print scriptures everywhere!  Then I went to Italy.  I needed books for the flights, plus my scriptures for daily reading.  I loaded up my Kindle app, and finished the books on the flights that I had received for Christmas...had my daily scripture reading, and added little weight to my luggage and more importantly...took little space in my luggage!  Since my trip, I have continued reading at night in bed with my Kindle app and no longer have to worry about getting up to turn off the light.  The more I use it, the more I like it...and I recently learned that I can &#34;check out&#34; books from the public library, and am no longer limited to the large print section!  Also, my husband and I often like to read a book the other has purchased.  With large numbers, books can be &#34;loaned&#34; to the other.  Wonderful!

While the Kindle app does have some good settings like highlighting a word to get the definition, font size and text, easy sync and great night mode. The formatting leaves a lot to be desired. Bundle books become one long book and all the books I have read have yet to have an option of jumping or returning to a page or chapter. Which come to think of it I have not actually read a book with page numbers, just percent of how much of the book has been read. The free books and having them linked to my Amazon account are a plus but the formatting takes this app from great to just okay.

Had to remove it from my phone, but that was because of RAM problems, not the app itself. It does have a few cool &#34;sister&#34; apps that are separate apps working in conjunction w/ it, but the app itself is about what you would expect. May very well work better on the Kindle hardware, but I don't see the point in purchasing a tablet when I have a smart phone, a laptop, and 2 desktops already. I personally prefer Adobe Digital Editions and the Nook apps (Barnes & Noble), but mostly just because I am more familiar, having used them both first, and I actually would rather have a paper book than any of them. If you need a decent reader app, this one is just as good as the next, so go ahead and try it out, just make sure to comparison shop.

I was very worried that I was going to lose all my books in process  of reading. The Kindle DX screen had an unfortunate case non working  mode when the screen went dark with some lines through.

Well after doing a quick search there it was. So now I am able to load  the book in am reafing.forvnow. I am not interested in making my Galaxy Note an e reader, even though the large screen does a great job and it really is a phone. So being old school I prefer to have a separate piece of hardware for the ereader. Ok......I know it's a lame excuse but I really want a Kindle had in color. I really thought the DX would satisfy my cravings for a. Monochrome ereader, but something was missing........oh Yeh COLOR!!!!!So. Here I am typing on my android device. Plugging bit into either a win 7 or vista or Apple  operating systems and wondering when did a phone become a highly sophisticated palm pilot...see in told u I'm old school.  In any case since I forgot what I was reviewing .....oh, the Kindle for Android . Yup great idea and works perfectly...After all I am a man of few words.....lol

The ability to read books, change font size, turn pages quickly is fine. It's the organization, or lack there of, that drives me crazy. I have no idea which books I've read, which ones I've not read. I can't put them into folders or categories like I could on my kindle. It would be nice to file books I've finished into a separate folder, or if there was a way to  tell which books I've read or not in the list of books. That's really irritating. My kindle fire it told me which books I've opened, and which ones were new. This app doesn't do that. I read at least 5 books a week and need a way to organize them, this app falls short.

My only issue is I can't create collections so that I can store the books I have read, in a folder, while allowing the ones I haven't read to be out in the open. But other than that, I have no complaints.edited to add:  I have found that I can delete the books off of my tablet and they remain in my Kindle acct @Amazon.  So while I still can't put them in collections, I can remove them without losing them forever.This app would be also be better if the sorter worked better. I find that some of my books appear under the "Most Recent" not in the order that I bought them. This creates an issue with me as I have a lot of books downloaded and would like to read the oldest ones first. Sometimes the newest ones I bought down at the bottom where the oldest ones are located. I also notices that if I update the books because of the author correcting errors, that the book then appears at the top where my newest books are located. The original buy date should be used for sorting by most recent.

The app was fast and reliable, and made it easy to read an ebook from Amazon on my Nook Color (with N2A).Then I bought a couple of new Kindle books, and Kindle (the app) would not download them unless I updated the app. The new app starts with a gray sphere and freezes there for a long time. Then it loads, and the default screen is not my library but the Kindle store with recommendations. A few buttons later I finally get to select my book and read it. Meanwhile, the app still doesn't allow you to group the books by topic.This spells the end of Kindle for me. I'll move my books over to Calibre, which doesn't try to sell anything and does allow for sorting books.

For that purpose it works. It could definitely be better though.Amazon needs to sync personal documents as well as purchased books. If this is a mobile platform for my books why can't all my books come over? Some may point out that personal documents have delivery fees, but that is only using Amazon's 3G and this app uses our networks. Also, why not let us target our app instead of or along with our Kindle? This would require us to be given a unique @Kindle.com email address, but it could work.I also want the app to sync highlighted notes / clippings from when I read on my Kindle.Finally, I want to be able to highlight and share quotes from my clippings like on my Kindle.This app works, but not better than Aldiko and definitely not better than a real Kindle.

Many free books by big-name authors available,  with as many as 75 new ones a day (some days 0, 1, 2 etc.) sometimes there is plenty to read,  free or to buy at good prices. Works well, although mine on a DROIDX run sometimes shuts down for no apparent reason. Only capable of using kindle files. Overall, probably my most used program. NOT AS GOOD AS AN ACTUAL KINDLE ! YOU CAN'T DO VIDEO BOOKS, ETC. Limitations. They won't make it much better as they want you to buy a kindle.

Most pros are advantages of any Kindle, with smaller form-factor.Con:- Most cons are about poor UI.- Too difficult to take desired actions after reading a sample- Kindle Store and Amazon.com are SO unrelated, one wonders:(1) Was there ANY Systems Integration in programming process?(2) Does ANYONE in Marketing or Sales want to make it easy (maybe user-friendly) for us to purchase content (that we have decided we want)? Or to let our WishLists know what we WANT?- should integrate WELL with both Amazon mobile apps & with full web-site.- "Don't judge book by it's cover?" Bad enough that e-readers lose the sensory aspects of reading - but the lag-time (till next download or more) to SEE the cover? If we can't have "feel" of a book, would be nice to have more of the "look"- Many features not available. Example: During past year, Many Kindle-benefits are advantages of Amazon Prime Membership. BUT, these features are not compatible w this app.With all these cons, and I could list more, why am I giving 3 stars, instead of 1-2? I don't own a Kindle - nor, would I always carry it. So, this app lets me read content anywhere, from phone.

I can disable wifi (to save battery usage) after launching, but operation is significantly slower with eBooks already saved on device. The only thing this Kindle app does is download a giant list of arbitrary 'recommended' and 'best seller' cover pics that I have no interest in and cannot disable. All I wanted to do is read books from  a car or a park bench, for which this app is COMPLETELY worthless. Might as well stick to paper books.

The ability to add support for lookup in user defined wikis would be great too.Highlighting text spanning more than one page can be difficult or impossible.  Regarding selection of text, is being able to copy a sentence no more than a few times a day such a problem for publishers? This would be useful for quoting books.Otherwise this app is the best reader I've used, though the first point makes it necessary to have another reader installed.

For example, I have been steadily working my way through Ken McClure's medical thrillers at $5 per book (out of print every way but Kindle for his older books).  It has been a great reading experience.  Ironically, I use my Kindle app more than my sister uses her actual Kindle.  I've also read ebooks on Good Reader and iBooks.  I'd say Kindle holds its own with both of those.

I loved the ease of reading e books with this app so much that I got a Kindle as well for the extra features. It gives me the best of everything. I am never without a book now but have no more piles of books all over. The sync between Android &amp; Kindle works flawlessly for me. Books can be archived online so I can go back &amp; read again. This is great for me because I love series fiction and sometimes forget things before the next book comes out. There is some content you can't get with the app you can with Kindle. I think maybe Amazon wants to keep a few things out of the app so people still buy Kindles. Something else that makes having both worthwhile is that Kindle is totally non glare so you can read outside but not backlit (which is easier on the eyes) while my phone has backlight so I can read in dark/dim light.

I have since also installed it on my rooted B&N; Nook Color, and enjoy it even more.This is a very convenient way to read since the program offers very stable performance, allows extensive customizations (such as changing font size and screen brightness), and remembers where in the book you last left off. I frequently use this program in the subway, it is great for when you want to relax but you don't have a cell signal to run some other programs.The real benefit of reading through the Kindle app as opposed to some alternatives is that the checkout process is lightning-fast. You can also frequently get free books for Kindle, so not only am I able to read more conveniently, but more cheaply, too!I am currently running it on my Droid 2 Global running Froyo (2.2), and have had no problems. While you can't download onto a tablet or AT&T; phone through the Amazon Appstore yet, you can get this through the Android Market on those devices.

First of all imagine you had to carry you best 10 books on you or with you everywhere you went.. It would far better having just the words in these books without the paper used to put the ink on it.

One has android 2.1 and is basically only a back up now.  The other two Samsung Galaxy Tab 7. 2 and Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 both have this app installed.  I read from whichever one is appropriate at the time.  I both buy books and get library books on this app and it works terrifically.  Get it you'll use it.  It's easy

I find the android version especially good for reading in bed with the lights out. Like when your better half is sleeping. I switch the text to white, background to black, and the brightness on the lowest setting and all is good. The potential detraction of the small screen is well made up for by the light weight & ease of handling with the phone. I can easily one-hand it and switch positions without much fuss. With a little practice, I can even change pages with one hand, swiping with my thumb. I've also found this app convenient for waiting room time at doctors & dentist appointments.With the addition of whispersynch, I can switch between my kindle and android phone with ease. Each time, the current device offers to take me right to where I was reading on the other device and with a click, I'm right where I left off.  Heh, I can imagine a decade from now explaining to the youngsters about the days before whispersynch, much to their disbelief and bemusement. Cheers.

It is fairly easy to learn the different features and is pretty intuitive. My Kindle has both WiFi and a connection to work off a cell signal. I wish the basic instructions for setting up the cell connection had been included with the Kindle. I did get help from Amazon but it was a little frustrating.

Easy in a book. Impossible on the Kindle without messing up my forward progress.Now it tells me how much is left in the chapter at the bottom of each page.It says it in minutes rather than pages. I'm not sure why. Pages make more sense, but it say it, and that works beautifully.

Buy once and read on all your devices is misleading.  I just bought a new phone and can't put half my books on it because it says I ran out of licenses for that book so they want me to buy them again or get rid of some of my devices!  Sounds like false advertising!  I am one that HATES to read but LOVE my kindle (no kidding!), I've read more books since I got my kindle than I have in 20 years because I really like the kindle but now I'm getting where I can't even put all my content on my devices out of fear of losing access to them all if I keep upgrading so be careful with adding lots of kindle software to all your devices as you just might run out of access to your library.  By the way, I'm the only one with access to my devices as I have to family to share them with, so there will never be 2 devices reading anything at the same time.....just me with lots of gadgets and now I can't even put my library on all my devices....5 stars if advertising was correct.....BUY ONCE, READ EVERYWHERE?????  More like buy once, read on first few devices you install it on and don't upgrade either or you can lose access to your library.....Either way I still like my kindle keyboards that have all my books on them although I'm afraid to upgrade them now.......Danny

Wherever I am, I have my whole library with me on my phone, my tablet, Kindle Fire, or pc. I thought I would miss having &#34;real&#34; books but the advantages far outweigh that loss. It's easier to hold, especially when reading in bed. I can change the page colors, letter size and spacing to avoid eye fatigue. No more lost books, bookmarks or places. I'm able to instantly look up an unfamiliar word rather than guessing at the meaning. Seriously, do you keep reading or run to find a dictionary when you come across one of &#34;those&#34; words? I'm able to easily highlight passages I want to remember. I can shop for a favorite/new book any time, anywhere. I don't have to buy more bookcases or find places for my books. It's simple (and free) to find and read those classics I always told myself I would read &#34;someday&#34;. Kindle even has sales on books. I have discovered new favorite authors by taking advantage of the countless free books offered daily. My grandchildren know Grandma always has a new book to read to them. I still love bookstores, but Kindle gives me so much more to choose from and this store is always open!

Other than that a good ebook reader, even if it is heavily DRMed.

By far, my most used App, Kindle for Android was as easy to use as the Kindle.  Now, I have to select the home tab to get to my books.  When I open the app, I'm opening to read. . .  not have suggestions shoved down my throat.  Amazon, you already have my business; please let me have my Kindle for Android app back.  Or, could you at least give me the option to not have selections glaring at me when I open the app?This was a 5 star app until the most recent update.  I understand that most people probably like the changes but how about considering those of us who don't?

It does not recognize the information when I try to log on (both are correct, I've quadruple checked, and I use them everyday on Amazon.com).  I plan to get an iPad in the near future to replace the Kindle Fire HD (which is as glitchy as can be) and when I do, how will I read my Kindle books if the app acts the same on the iPad?  Guess I'll be getting my books at iTunes, even though I'd rather not.I'm actually a huge fan of Amazon, but recent experiences are souring me, because of their software issues, and a couple of bad calls to customer service.  I miss the Amazon of two years ago.  :-(A Kindle app I can't sign into is pretty much useless.

You can get quite a few books from the Kindle Book store for the same price as 1 book retail in the stores. They have tons of free books, and alot more pretty cheap.

It's a little more cumbersome to get your books off the cloud, but once downloaded to your android (Galaxy tablet in my case), this works out just fine. On the Asus and Dell Windows 8.1 tablets (which are actually PCs), it's even more difficult to access the cloud for previously purchased books. I won't take any stars away for that, but only because there may be an easier way and I'm new to Win8 tablets. (Aren't we all?) Considering how many android apps there are, however, I am at a point where I can say that Android is far easier to deal with vis a vis Kindle and apps in general.

I own a Kindle, an I-device and an Android tablet. Amazon has never let me down when it comes to e-reading. All of my books easily sync to each device and the eBooks are always sitting quietly in my library patiently waiting their turn to be read.  I love the fact that every single book, no matter what device I read them on, can be read off-line. The number of free and for purchase books is never ending. The Android app. is just as user friendly as an actual Kindle. Step 1: Set up an account. Step 2: Choose a book. Step 3: Read.  Oh, get this...when you call Amazon with a Kindle question - you get a real live person, who actually helps. Get this app!

I went to Italy with several books loaded and it was nice to be able to read on the plane, tour bus, etc. without the weight of a book in my hand.  The app is very easy to use and I like the new updates; books are easy to find on the carousel.  This is the first app I loaded when I had to change phones recently... couldn't imagine my phone without it.  Even my 82 y.o. mother has gotten into the swing with her new phone.  She rarely makes calls but loves to have a book close at hand!

I absolutely love getting books from Amazon!But all is not perfect with this app. Twice I have turned on my Nook only to find out that the reading app has decided to put all my books over into my Archive area. All my books! Each & every one of them! So frustrating! I've contacted support about this twice for no answers. My sister's has done the same thing several times as well.Also I understand that Kindle users have the option of categorizing or organizing their books - wish we with the app could do that too. To mark them as read, unread or make a note regarding the book. Also to be able to leave a review for a book directly from the app as opposed to logging into Amazon to do so.We have no way to remove the books from our device once they are downloaded. They just continue to clutter up the device unless you choose to delete them entirely from your Amazon library. Some books that's ok for but then some books you might want to keep & loan out but not have them remain on your device.I noticed we have not had an update on the app since 2011...please give us categories, a way to mark them, option to remove books from device & leave in our library, a way to leave a review on a book without opening a browser & getting to Amazon and fix the bug that causes the app to move our books to Archive without our permission!

It picks up where you left off as long as the WiFi is on regardless of what device you are on.  We use it on our Kinles of course, our smart phones, and now our ePads.  The vendor of the ePad said Kindle would not work without a difficult download of an older version of the app; then an update by replacing it with a new app.  None of that was required.  I just downloaded the Kindle app for Android and it works right out the shoot.  It even does somethings better than the Kindle itself.  The battery is much better on the Kindle, but having the ePad option just makes it even better.

The app works great for reading.  A phone, even with the bigger screens on new phones, is not perfect, but since you have your phone nearly 24/7, this is a great way to kill any down time you get hit with.The synch feature is great if you have a kindle.  When you load up a document you've also read on the Kindle, it offers to move you to the furthest page you've reached.  This is the one flaw, however.  If you load up the app to check your position and update to where you are on a Kindle, you can't back out of the app without losing your place.  There's no quit option, and the phone's equivalent of escape simply undoes the synch, then lets you quit.  You're required to continue reading, I guess.Still, the app is amazing, free, and is a gateway to a great many books which are also free, in addition to whatever you might buy.EDIT - Touch the text of the book to bring up the various menus and symbols, then hit the Kindle symbol in the upper left to exit the book without losing your place.  Not exactly intuitive, but it works.

So far, it has twice posted an error saying (something to the effect) that the titles I downloaded were not properly registered and to delete and download them again. They read properly after each new download, but I can't say it won't happen again. Just hope it isn't right after I've boarded a plane.The satisfaction of immediately reading a purchase (after download - I don't do clouds), having a library (which can contain groups) in such a small package, and the typical cost savings between the electronic and the tree editions of a publication are definite pros. Also, the dictionary works well, and I like that books reopen where I left off.On the other hand, I have failed to determine where the downloads are being saved. I want to force them to my external SD card since my internal memory is limited and many applications won't run from anywhere else. I can't find any setting for selecting the download destination, and haven't been able to find the actual files, yet, to see where they've been saved. Even if they are going where I'd like, I consider the inability to specify a location an irritating omission.I would still recommend this product, particularly since it's 1) free, 2) easy to use, and 3) removable.

There are drawbacks I don't like. Number one being that there are no page numbers and sometimes there is no way to navigate chapters. If you lose your place at times you have to flip through and hope to find it again or trial and error. There needs to be a page location that is not just 374 out of 1000, which doesn't reflect the page number. The other thing I don't like is that you can't organize your books. There is no way to make a book playlist by author or by name. I wanted to separate the same author books into the proper series to read by and it won't let me at all, which is frustrating. Other than that though, it is a good app and swiftly allows downloads of new items. Also multiple book bundles get a little wonky when trying to find another book within the bundle to read.

I have over 50 or so books on it so far and was just a few weeks ago talking to my mom about getting a Kindle. It is convenient for me to have the computer app though as I am a full time student getting a degree in Internet Marketing/New Media online so I spend a great deal of time on my computer. It has become a part of me at this point, I think.But, I also downloaded the Kindle app for my Android phone which I was asked to review. It absolutely makes me so angry I see red and I am a pretty laid back person about technology because when you deal with them all the time; you must learn patience for those days that they have minds of their own.But, seriously, the Kindle app for my Android worked fine for the first 2 books I got. Ever since, it has been a battle between me, the app, and the Amazon site as the app will not sync all of the books I have on all of my other apps. I have done everything I can think of. I have uninstalled it and re-installed it 2 times and still nothing. I find it so frustrating because I really really want it to work. I LOVE the kindle idea. I live in an apartment and do not have a ton of room for hard cover books. Whoever thought up the Kindle idea is brilliant. It is perfect for people now a days who are always on the go; but I BEG of you, Amazon, re-evaluate your Android Kindle App PLEASE!!! PRETTY PLEASE!! It was so great having those first 3 books with me everywhere I went.Thank you for your time and I do hope if you do download the app as I did; you all have better luck.Regards,~ Holley Jacobs

It works perfectly on all of them!!  I've never had it crash.I know this is a review for the Android version, but I only mention my other devices because of the fact that I love how it sync's information between devices.  I did not know this as I had read most of a book on an iTouch and then stopped reading it for a few months.  When I installed it on my Evo I re-downloaded the book thinking I might go ahead and finish it but was concerned that I might not remember where I left off.  but when I opened the book, it took me right to the spot I had left off.I must say, this impresses the living daylights out of me!!  Thank you, Amazon, for adding that as a feature.Otherwise, it does everything you need in a book reader.  You can bookmark, you can change the size of the text, you can even change the coloring (I prefer Sepia when reading during the day and Black when reading at night).  In the Android version you can even "share" your progress so you can brag about what you've read to all your friends or those who might be reading with you.  You can even shop for books right inside the app.I love this and it is no wonder that Kindle is such a strong contender in the eReader fields and it is always the first ebook reader I install any time I get a compatible device.  I look forward to what they release in the future as I'm sure it will only get better.

I email Amazon and they replied "at this time, the password feature is not available on Kindle app for Android". That is a terrible way to do business. It is very shady to try to get people to constantly buy things buy accident. They demand card information and then offer no protection once the app is on you phone or tablet. Anyone (including my children just trying to read their chapter book for school) could buy books accidentally. What a shady business strategy! I am VERY disappointed in you Amazon. I expected better from you. This is shameful exploitation of loyal customers.

It took 2 weeks before I was addicted. After 3 months, my husband threatened to divorce me. I got an android phone. This was my first downloaded app. I thought the kindle was wonderful. This app takes kindle to a whole new level. I won't go into the free and low cost books, the instant no fuss no muss whispernet delivery. I will say that I love the responsive page turning, the double tap highlight, the COLOR interface (book cover art is important when picking my next read!) I was surprised that I didn't hate the backlighting which by the way, can be adjusted by the user and can be read outside (although admittedly strong sunlight is still an issue).  Not only can you control brightness, you can control the page color (3 choices- white, sepia and black). As on kindle, you can pick your fonts and size. You can mark passages, look up words, and search.  You can read in either landscape or portrait (I find landscape flows better.  I can pull it out anywhere and I don't get the stares I used to when I pulled out my kindle (picture standing in line at the grocery). I love that it doesn't eat my battery. I read an entire book over a 4 hour period and still had over 60% left on my battery on an android phone. The kindle app doesn't have text to speech (that I have found) but that isn't an issue for me. Awesome app and it is free!! You can't go wrong.

I think I installed the Kindle reader first.  It's a nice implementation and I can't think of anything off hand that I would do to improve the user interface EXCEPT you should be able to see the time while reading.  Doh.  I don't want to have to exit the reader to see what time it is.  Ok, so the Archos 43 has a large screen, and I can see that one might not want to use up the screen real estate that way on a smaller screen - but make it an option then.  Please.  Pretty please.---2012/11/29 Update:  The app can open PDFs, so it is not necessary to have another PDF reader taking up space on your device.  I love that.  I hate that Amazon apps are HUGE and get more HUGE with every update.  This should be App2SD.  I'm going to downgrade my 5 rating to 4 on this point alone.  I love the reader, but the size of the app is making me have to uninstall other stuff to keep it on.  At some point, the Amazon app is going to have to go so I can keep the other stuff on the tablet.  Get a clue Amazon.  You are in the app store business.  When your apps take up all the room on the device, people can't buy other apps anymore!

I like how it gauges and displays the time left in each chapter. I also like how that time is continuously updated (like when I stop reading for a bit and then resume). I suppose I mostly appreciate the percentage of the book already read. Really gives me a true location to where I currently am in the book.. this feature also estimates the time to the end when I open a book that I have already read, basing its estimate on how long it took me the last time to read cover to cover. Not necessarily needed info but nice to know what I average from book to book. This app will stay on my RAZR Maxx until I buy a Kindle Fire later this fall.

Those are the times that I really enjoy the Kindle App.  Several people have asked me how I get a Kindle book to open on my cell phone.  They are totally unaware of the Kindle App.  It is one of the best kept secrets by Amazon Kindle.  I think Amazon should do more open advertising of this hidden feature.

It is really easy to use which is super important for people like me who are not tech savvy at all. One of the things that I have loved about it is that when I click on the "store" button, it takes me to the app version of Amazon. Tonight when I clicked on "store", it took me to Amazon's actual Web page which is much more difficult to navigate on my little tablet (Samsung galaxy). I'm hoping this is just a glitch and not an actual change.I had previously installed both the Kindle app and the Nook app, but after a month or so I realized that I liked the Kindle app much better and deleted the Nook app. Now I'm hoping I don't have to go back to that one. Please fix!!Okay. . . so about two days later I figured out that I may possibly have been the one who just didn't know what I was doing. It's back to working for me now, so I have changed my review to 5 stars. Love this app!

I'm reading books that I love on it, and getting the full effect I would from having an actual book in my hand. There are two suggestions I could make. One is sometimes the words in the book are incorrect, and I don't think it's a typo, because some of the sentences are a mixture of the English language and I think it was French. I've only found two sentences like that. My other suggestion is that maybe the books could be a little cheaper. I don't have the room on my Android tablet to keep all of my favorite books, so I might have to delete them in order to download others. That's a little bit of a waste of money on my part. Thanks for hearing my comments and suggestions!

The library is simple to browse and find what you're looking for, which seems to be a complaint for a lot of e-readers. It also keeps track of your progress automatically, so if you're the type to read multiple novels at once, then this app is sure to please!Would prefer if there was an easy way to upload / link books from anywhere, but it looks as though you can ONLY read books from the amazon kindle store unless you manually put them on the phone / SD card through a USB cable. Other than that limitation, it works like it's supposed to and doesn't drain the battery too much. Watch out when buying, though! While there are a ton of cheap / free books, and Amazon isn't shy about showing you the more expensive stuff. One-tap ordering means you can easily purchase something you didn't want if you don't pay attention.Overall, it's not spectacular, but it works like it should and is an app that no one should pass up.

That just changed, I received an Android tablet (10.7 inch) for my birthday in January, and didn't do much with it until recently. I was in Amazon App store to download a timer for poker when I came across the Kindle app. So I downloaded that as well, while looking to order a new book from one of my favorite authors, I noticed that he had written several short stories for the Kindle only. I ordered the stories, and was delighted with the ease of operation in downloading to the tablet, the ease in reading while in bed, on the couch, room lights on or off. I am definitely a believer in e-books now. I still like print books for the beach and pool, but the Kindle is great for the other times that weather is not an issue for electronics. Definitely recommend this to all the readers out there.

I was also using a Kindle Bible in church to quickly jump to the  'Table of Contents' then to the chapter (Book) I wanted. After this last update there is no '2 touch' go to contents any more. In fact the "Table of Contents" in the menu will not even take you to a  'Table of Contents'. To change books in the Bible I have to:1. go to the menu2. choose Navigation3. from there I can choose  'Table of Contents'4. choose book5 choose chapterBy then it is too late. Other books don't have a "Navigation" choice. How about a 'Go to  'Table of Contents' ' in the  'Table of Contents' tab...come on this is common sense. Why even call it  'Table of Contents' if it does not take you there.

We both used the older Kindle tablets that didn't have the back lit screen, so always needed some kind of additional lighting if reading in a dim area or in the evening.  I decided to download this app for my Nexus 7 and am quite pleased with it.  I am able to access the entire library and read in darkened areas without fumbling with some type of additional light source.  It has been great for reading while on airplanes, camping or when I'm some place where lighting isn't adequate to read from my old Kindle tablet.  I also downloaded it on my wife's Ipad as well as the kid's Coby tablet, but have not tried it on the Coby as of yet.  The downside is, the Nexus 7 and Coby have to be in a area where there's WiFi access to download from Amazon or access books in our stored library, whereas, the Kindle tablet has fairly reliable satellite access, similar to a cell phone.  This is not a big problem, as I download several books to the Nexus 7 memory before I go anywhere there may be limited or no WiFi access.

These restricted titles also may not be accessed on Kindle reading applicationsThis quote appeared on my library's website as I was trying again and again to download a restricted book. I know kindle may not have much to do with this problem, but couldn't you provide some understandable documentation about how to download via usb to a computer in order to get it to an android reader, as opposed to a Kindle, or an off market reader? And what does the last line even mean?I never, ever get the drop down box to transfer to the usb and I can only assume it is the Android Device, but still, some documentation would help.

I have, to date, bought one for: myself, my wife, 3 of my sisters, and soon to be a 4th sister.  However, unless I will be traveling, or unless I plan to sit down and read for an extended period of time, I tend to not want to carry around the full-sized Kindle reader device with me.  I would prefer to use my phone, or read on my computer.  Enter the Kindle reader for the Android. It works beautifully.  It auto-syncs when you first start it, and then you can turn pages by slide-gesturing, or using the arrow keys on the keypad (if you have a keypad on your Android phone). You can also highlight, and annotate, as well as increase or lower font size, line spacing, etc.  The only thing it won't do, is read to you like the Kindle can do, when you enable screen-reading.  Not too shabby for a free application.Battery drain while using it to read non-stop for 2 hours was about 35% of my total battery life, on a battery which will give me 4 hours with constant use, with a full charge.  Not bad, but not fantastic, either.  However, the Samsung Galaxy Indulge has pretty terrible battery life in general (I always carry a spare with me), so take that estimate with a grain of salt, your mileage may vary.

I love this app because it allows me to pick up reading a book where I left off reading on the PC or other Kindle device.The recent addition of access to public library books is great! (However, this still needs to be done via the Internet outside of the app - hopefully they will integrate into the app in the future) I can borrow books from my public library for free for 2 weeks at a time! I love this, I will probably save a good deal of money in late fees because when the lending period expires, the book is automatically returned! No need to worry about getting to the library to return a book in order to avoid late fees!This app is constantly updated and improved as well, but it has been extremely good for quite some time now. I love that the reading background colors, brightness, text size, and word spacing can all be adjusted to fit your needs or preferences.A great way to make good use of my time while in waiting rooms!

Syncs flawlessly,  adjustable fonts, different lighting levels... ;)  Only thing it needs are real page numbers and real in book dictionary.

I was able to move right onto the Kindle app on my Droid and be completely happy.It is a well arranged app - and while not a Kindle, it definitely does the job very, very well.

The app works smoothly, and I've had no problems with it at all. I enjoy having some books with me on my phone; it's surprising how often I read something using the Kindle app on my phone when I'm waiting for an appointment somewhere. I still carry and use my Kindle 3, but this app has turned my phone into a very handy supplement to the Kindle. Syncing to the "furthest location read" between and among my Kindle-equipped devices has always been easy and accurate.

It is really easy to use which is super important for people like me who are not tech savvy at all.  One of the things that I have loved about it is that when I click on the "store" button, it takes me to the app version of Amazon.  Tonight when I clicked on "store", it took me to Amazon's actual Web page which is much more difficult to navigate on my little tablet (Samsung galaxy).  I'm hoping this is just a glitch and not an actual change.I had previously installed both the Kindle app and the Nook app, but after a month or so I realized that I liked the Kindle app much better and deleted the Nook app.  Now I'm hoping I don't have to go back to that one.  Please fix!!Okay. . . so about two days later I figured out that I may possibly have been the one who just didn't know what I was doing.  It's back to working for me now, so I have changed my review to 5 stars.  Love this app!

Amazon is one of my fav sites and has made my life so much easier.  My only complaint is that on my tablet I cannot read the first or second sentence on the top of each page b/c there is a status bar there.. At one point last week it went away and i had the book on my entire screen but i have no idea how i got it that way and it hasn't happened since then.  If anyone knows how to fix this i would greatly appreciate the help!

The only thing I would like to see added to this app is a way to do a one-touch download of all books purchased. I scanned through and ordered about 50 books from my computer, thinking they would automatically get sent to my tablet, but they didn't. The covers do, but then you hav eto go through one by one to download the books themselves. I'd rate 5 stars if not for this.

Books which were recently read will come up as no longer being recognized.  It will then either require me to attempt to open it several times, or delete and redownload the book.2.  The time left grows significantly during the reading of each chapter.  I will go from 15 mins left on the first page of a chapter to 36 minutes left on the last page of the chapter.  I know my reading speed hasn't changed, but about every 2-3 pages, it likes to add a minute to the remaining time.I am currently using the Note 3, however the 2nd problem also existed on the Evo 4G I was using for a bit.Once these two items are taken care of, I will be more than happy to change it back to a 5-star rating, as this truly is one of the better reading apps.

Runs horribly now even on a dual core and is literally 10 times larger than a year ago and for what? Please, please stop this and optimize this app!!!! I hate giving it one star but there is no excuse for this. And WHY do you store the book data in the app/system space instead of of user/sdcard storage space? AND when one deletes (archives) a book, why doesn't the app remove it from local storage? Why are these very basic housekeeping functions and storage decisions so poorly implemented? :(

Amazon isn't doing me a favor by making an ebook app that works for me, they owe it to me.Margins:When I read a physical book, there are reasonable margins.  When I read a DRM-free ebook on a feature-rich open source e-reader app on my galaxy tab, I have reasonable margins between the edge of the screen and the edge of the tablet.  When I read a Kindle ebook on the Kindle app on my galaxy tab, I have EXTRA LARGE margins in portrait mode thanks to the built in, non-configurable software margins.  When I tilt the tablet a few degrees too far to the right or left (surprisingly easy to do when you have the tablet tilted back a little), I get EXTRA LARGE margins on the top and bottom of the screen, and DELUXE SUPER JUMBO margins on the right and left.Screen Rotation:On my phone, the Kindle app is great.  The software margins aren't an issue since my phone doesn't have built in margins around the screen, and I can tell the Kindle app not to change orientations when I tilt the phone by pressing a mysterious lock icon that appears when I tilt it.  On my tablet, the Kindle app team has decided that users don't like locking the screen rotation, so they've completely removed that feature.  They say that it's easy to lock the screen rotation in Android 3.0, but it's actually only one click less to lock the screen in Android 3.0 than to lock it in Android 2.X, plus there's the fact that I don't want to have to enter Kindle App Mode every time I try to read a Kindle ebook.The only reason I'm giving it two stars rather than one is because the Kindle app is still at least twice as good as the Barnes and Noble Nook app, for what it's worth.

My criteria are that it must sync ratings both ways, work with smart play lists in iTunes, sync play counts, and be user friendly.  I found nothing else even close to this app.  I use the WiFi sync add-on with this. I once had a problem with a non US phone, and the developers fixed the problem immediately.  Very responsive.  Bought it here in Amazon because the other market doesn't work when I travel...  No complaints after almost 1 year.

With my new phone, Galaxy Note 2, for some reason I wasn't able to get all my music onto the phone. Many songs would be missing, and it would take forever to transfer the music. I tried several times and finally decided to see if there was a good app out there as I was becoming frustrated.I found iSynr, which I've heard of in the past but didn't feel the need to have. I decided to try it, I use iTunes anyway on my computer. It was amazing! It was fast, transferred all my songs and cover art, and on top of that all my playlists.This is by far one of the best apps I've purchased through the years and well worth the cost. For smooth syncing and music control from computer to phone and back again don't fear wasting your money on this app.

Even restored Kindle to new condition and tried again. Customer service was prompt in responding and suggested I download their (free) music player and use that one instead of Amazon's.  Worked like a charm and now this is JUST what I needed.  Maybe I missed it, but never saw that piece of advice in my installation instructions, so I would recommend they add that so people like me don't get confused (I'm pretty tech savvy too, so if I didn't get it, I'm sure others would benefit from that bit of info!).  Still I'm happy enough to go from 1 star to FIVE stars.  They got it right!

I figured I could save the cost of upgrading to a newer iPod by just copying podcasts from my iTunes library to my new KFHD8.9. I couldn't find any easy way to do this until December 28, 2012 when Amazon featured iSyncr at a discount and so caught my attention. I purchased it and it turned out to be exactly what I needed. I did have to experiment with various settings to finally understand the terminology and to adjust the options to my liking. I prefer syncing over USB because the syncing control panel on the PC is more understandable to me and easier to use than the panel on the KFHD. Now, any time I update my podcasts in iTunes on my desktop PC I am just a few clicks away from having everything synced for listening on my KFHD.

It &lt;&lt;NEVER>> imported all my music even though I checked carefully to ensure I hadn't gone over the level. It may have been something I am doing wrong, but I doubt it. The app asks you where you want the stuff loaded to, then arbitrarily decides where to load the stuff to. Save your time and money. I'm looking for a better solution, and in the meantime, I'm doing this the old-fashioned way. Hey! CDs!

Songbird would take for-ev-er to mount the SD card, Doubletwist recopied all my songs every time and HTC sync took five minutes to update the library and then at least an hour and a half to sync playlists and then copy songs.  I could find no program that seemed to sync as quickly and accurately as iTunes synced my iPod Touch. Now I have.I'm using iSyncr for both my HTC Evo phone and my Acer Iconia tablet. I had trouble with a couple of songs the first couple of times I tried to sync, but once I unchecked those and ran one full sync (about 4500 songs) they synced fine the second time.  Of course the first sync took a long time since the songs had to be copied fully.  What has amazed me is how iSyncr performs on subsequent syncs.  It seems to sync only what has changed and gets the sync over and done with.  I can now sync whenever I want - I don't have to set aside time to make sure the sync happens. I can sync and go - just like iTunes works with my iPod Touch.To the developer:  THANK YOU.

I cared enough to vote. One star is more than zero. The that is my intuition. So I rebel against having to give more stars to rank it higher. An app that gets many votes is more valued or resented than, eh its not the place for this. Ok 2 stars.

Although I could see a kid having some fun with it, it did not entertain an adult for more than a few seconds. Nothing wrong with the app just not for me. Worked on 3.1, 3.2, 2.2 and 2.3 well with no crashes.

Can't figure out how to search for particular radio stations - the station call letters do not produce the desired station. Lists of stations, songs etc. not in alphabetical or numeric order. Profuse disorganization!Very unfriendly user interface - at least for this attempting user. No apparent help available explaining how to maneuver the app. I give up!

I wish the search option was better.  Maybe if hashtags were incorporated, it would help.  I don't like the fact that you have to pay for that.  The free version does the trick if you know what you are looking for.  Otherwise you might get a bunch of stations that you need to listen through before you get to what you really want.  The buffering is a bit bad.  I'd get alot of dropped signals when listening to stations in the gym.  Not sure if that is an app issue or the station stream.

A lot of times classical music works best. Iheartradio only has two stations. This app offers entire stations that specialize in classical guitar or Baroque or whatever.

There are tons of different radio stations for your listening pleasure.  You are guaranteed to find something that you like. It's a quality app that I have had no issues with. Also, If you're worried about permissions, just email the developer or go to their website.  The developer is very responsive, which is rare sometimes, with other developers.  Also those sticky intents permissiosn is not only on this app, it's on other apps as well - especially apps that have an alarm function, such as this one.  At $4, this app is a deal. Pandora is $36 per year (with no ads).

While mine wasnt available, I could listen to hers and while my favorite classical station was not available either, a short seach by Classical genre gave me several good choices as well as one with NO commercials (at least not so far). This is really a good app for my Kindle as I really enjoy listening to clasical music while reading and even while playing games.

I actually hope it does, for likeTuneIn Radio Prothere are a lot of local stations that I do not have access to, so for the momentiHeartRadiois the only one that I can listen to all local, and even some elsewhere that is ineligible for me onXiiaLive Proor TuneIn.The interface is a breeze to get through and to get used to. You can search songs, you can favorite songs; you can even tag songs, which is something that I haven't seen before. Overall, the app alone is pretty good. I just hope it gets improved by making more stations readily available.

I use a CUSTOM setting.It does have a couple of desirable features that are not easy to find, if you don't hold it right.Bitrate selection requires holding my tablet in portrait orientation and looking for the android-standard menu on the pull-down buttons.It is not Pandora and it isn't RealPlayer, so there are several internet radio sources that it can't play, but that doesn't mean it is the worst player out there.It just means that it won't play streams that aren't SHOUTcast streams, duh.And I finally found out how to close the player.Press the STOP button, first, and then exit the app with the BACK arrow.

It comes with 3 visual themes and also a lot of customization through the settings. Thanks Amazon, great FAOTD choice!

There are so many channels that it's going to take a long time to listen to them all.  Plenty of choices for everyone.The audio queues for connection and disconnection are nice when you don't have the screen on and wonder why your music stopped playing.  Doesn't seem related to the application at all because some of the channels were flawless and others disconnected quite a bit.  (Mostly those from across the world like Ukraine).Good app, thanks for picking a good one this time Amazon.

I had to have a sleep timer, I had to be able to add and modify an assortment of streams, had to play in the background, not a memory hog, good customer support, active program updates.  That shouldn't be too hard to find, those things, it is.  XiiaLive matches beautifully.Not only did I get what I needed, but also some really cool features I hadn't even thought of like the little alert sounds, which are extremely informative in the dark.  I listen to audio streams while nodding off to sleep so when it has to buffer or I drop connection, I don't have to physically look to see what happened.  I very rarely drop connection, but when I reconnect, I love the ball drop sound upon connection.I'm sure this app does more than I'm telling you, but for me, this is the best one and I'm picky.

I tried several radio stations and all of them came in clearly, no problem. I do wish the controls were a little more intuitive, especially when looking for a station. I had to really dig just to find Top 40, which is what I listen to most... as do most people. Also, I wish I could search by location as I'd rather listen to something local or from a specific country. No major complaints, but nothing about this blew me away either. If you are looking for Internet radio, try the trial first before dropping upwards of five dollars on this.

This is clearly stated in the description *XiiaLive is a fabulous app. I like the variety of options you're given. You can view your history, tag songs you'd like to remember, set alarms, change the theme, even scan stations.The interface is clean and it offers alternatives when I'm tired of listening to the same songs on my Mp3 player and the radio.One feature I appreciate about TuneIn that this app doesn't have is the ability to easily search using city and state. XiiaLive's results are shown as one long, random list, no categorizing or in any kind of order. And you have to type in the call letters / city yourself instead of conveniently choosing from a list.There is also no way to easily access the app. Instead of being able to simply swipe down the menu and see song info, you have to go all the way into the app from the homepage. Major design flaw and major annoyance.That being said, I've discovered some great online radio stations and new music. I dig this app and recommend it.

Right off the bat I played with it for a few minutes till I got a handle on how to maneuver. I made the kids laugh when I put the ear buds in my ears and danced to Celtic music around the house with my Kindle Fire stuck in my back waste-band.  Huge choice of streaming music from every genre from around the world. Since it was one of my new experiences in the e-music or streaming music, I'm hooked. Get this app, YES, recommended. .

As a Baby Boomer, I can't stand current music and only listen to the music I grew up with. I love the station selection on XiiaLive Pro. It works great on Kindle Fire.  My fave station is Fun 45's.com. If you were born in the 50's,  you'll love it too. Well worth the price.  No adds, no commercials, no problems at all, just great music.

Each genre seems to have a good variety of stations to choose from.  It is also easy to switch from station!  It is easy to use and you can leave it turned on while you switch to reading a book or a magazine.  This offers every type of music from classical to country.  There is nothing about this app that I did not like.This is one of my favorite apps.

I've only listened to a couple of stations and they're not quite what I expected, especially for a paid app.I tried the Irish Pub station and was really expecting more pub like music. Not everything I listened to was really what I would define as &quot;pub&quot; music, which I would define as something you'd hear at an Irish session.I also tried the Wacken station because I thought it'd have a decent selection of heavy metal. I haven't had time to listen it a lot, but I thought the Pogues was an interesting choice for a metal channel.Anyways, these seem like random Internet channels and I'm entirely convinced that all of them are good. Maybe it's just what I'm into. I'll play around with it more and see where it ends up.

I recommend TuneIn app which has better function to find local stations, (the TuneIn app made this easy). This app did not have as comprehensive catagory functions. Display of radio stations did not always display the station's logo, which makes quick selection more of a chllenge. I did not pay for this app, I got it with the free app of the day from Amazon, I would not pay for it, there are better apps such as TuneIn to go with.

It's smooth, awesome and works well. I recommend it. There are free radio apps that are good, too, but this one seems to run more smoothly and you actually get Shoutcast stations, which are hard to find free like this on Android. Not that this is free now.I like how the search feature searches songs that the stations are playing instead of the station name, but it would be nice if I could search the station name, too.

Most of the music apps that I have downloaded in the past have not lived up to my expectations however this app has truly amazed me that it allows me to listen to my favorite bands and songs. I especially love being able to tag my favorite songs and saving my favorite stations. This is a great app.

Easy to use and maneuver. Had problems connecting to a lot of stations. Had problems triong to figure out how to stop it and exit out of the app completely. I just ended up pausing it ans leaving it paused, until the middle of the night. It unpaused and scared me half to death, beings it was close to my head. I paused again and set it down.

I downloaded it twice, uninstalling in between and rebooting phone, and still kept getting the weird 'ball bouncing on hard floor' sound and 'Android Media console died' message no matter what radio station I tried.  I got one to stream for a few seconds but it kept losing the connection and going on and off.  I'm on Verizon 4G with a very strong signal. so it's just an app that won't work for me.

On this,or any other music app, I rarely see any comments regarding bit rate&hellip; Which makes me wonder if I am the only person with a mobile data-cap??? This app has a wonderful feature where when you search or browse stations you can filter by a certain bit rate of your choosing. For those of us with a data limit, this is amazingly useful. While I really like listening to Internet radio, I have no intention of using all of my mobile data in a short few days.Other nice features I didn't find elsewhere include a history of songs listened and the ability to tag a song for later viewing. This is wonderfully useful if you want to download the song from Amazonmp3 later on (when you get to a PC or within wifi?).Unfortunately, I do not see any local radio stations herein, nor any specific feature to pull up your local radio stations based on location, etc.. This is one feature I really like about TuneIn radio.All in all, a good app. Hopefully they continue to improve it, listening to feedback from users, and in the end make it a great music app.

It has a wide variety of different types of music to choose from and everything starts up quick.

My favorite radio apps are iHeart and Tunein for local radio. Xiialive has a wider variety of radio stations not found on either iHeart or Tunein. I searched for some of my favorite local stations I use in the other 2 apps and they are not available in xiialive.So instead of using xiialive to replace the other 2 which is what I had hoped it looks like it will compliment the other two apps.UPDATE: This is the FASTEST radio internet app I have used. I don't know how the devs did it but unlike the other internet radio apps you usually have to deal with the connection first then the buffering of the audio. With xiialive I have NOT encountered any buffering or connection issues. Playback is nearly instantaneous. I tried it from a range of radio stations from around the world including different genres and as soon as I selected the station the audio appeared.

It even has a alarm clock. I love this. It may even replace two or three of my music apps. So get this while you can for free and appreciate it. Thank you amazon for giving us apps that we can sometimes use.

I was intrigued by the equalizer, but you really can't tell THAT much of a difference on the Samsung Epic. The streaming is choppy (cuts out every 5-10 sec), and the app slows down other apps, e.g. words lag when typing on Tweetcaster.I also am confused and perhaps somewhat overwhelmed by what station to choose. The stations listed are the actual station names but don't really have a good description. You just have to assume the stations will play within the genre. I definitely prefer Pandora, which plays the next song based on songs you like and stays within the genre (or you can create your own station). The streaming on Pandora also isn't choppy. Maybe others have had better luck with this app, but I've already uninstalled it from my phone.

It is a bit higher priced than TuneIn Radio, but I think it is well worth it.  I'm still exploring around with it, so I may update with some criticism later.  For now, it is my go-to music app.

Beware of &quot;Sticky Notes&quot; That software gives the developer access to your data at any time and as a many times as they need. Also, why does it need to be on &quot;start up&quot;?
ASXYFYCPIP232,B004DM0UII,2.99180327869,0.470781573499,0.0278911564626,0.00136054421769,0.538,0.910869565217,TRUTHFUL,1) malicious intent because a sticky broadcast will blow by any other security and be global to the entire system. So they can easily be used for very nefarious reasons. 2) lazy programming. 3) some valid reason for some system level application that you truly truly trust that actually would need such access (I cannot think of a single example of a user level application that would need this level of access).Unexplained sticky intents in a radio app are EXTREMELY suspicious. They are global and they stick around forever. They also blow past all other permissions and security since they are intended to be used at the SYSTEM level only. No radio app ever needs that level of access! Ever ever ever! Sorry, but no way in heck will I install this and I will definitely warn people about it. I did "buy it" as the free app of the day but when I noticed the permissions I did not actually install it and I will not as long as they have these ridiculous permissions embedded in it. Shame on this developer for trying to pull a fast one (or so it seems).In fact, here is a direct quote from a developer of Android itself: " Er... there is NO reason to use sticky broadcasts for communication within your own app. In fact, I'll go farther and say you just should not do this. Sticky broadcasts are GLOBAL to the system. And because of this, performing a sticky broadcast is multiple orders of magnitude slower than just implementing direct calls within your own app (IPC for each receiver to register, IPC to the system to send it, IPC from the system back to your app to deliver it, marshalling and unmarshalling of all the data within the Intent over both IPCs).More than that, there is NO protection on them, so any other application can watch your sticky broadcasts, or even send their own values back to you. (Btw, this is also issue with using any broadcasts within your own app. Broadcasts are really there for cross-application communication. It is just far more efficient and easier to implement these things within an app by having a callback interface.)Now I am really regretting that I made that function public. :/> And of course, if you want out of application notifications, you have > no other option.You do have the option of using a normal broadcast rather than a sticky broadcast. You'll notice that there are basically no sticky broadcasts used by the system, at least that you see in the public APIs. In fact there are some places they are used internally, but even those are slowly going away as we discover security holes with them because there is no way to protect who can receive the broadcast data."If you Google a block of this post you will find the original source Amazon will not allow me to post a link to it. (Update you can find the link to this in Daniel's comment, below! Turns out that links seem to be okay in replies, just not in reviews? At least it wouldn't allow me to do it. No matter, it's there.)

Maybe I will try it again in a year or so, but right off the bat it did not connect to the first three music genre choices that I selected. Then, when it locked in on to what I was hoping to be an acoustic blues station, I ended up getting a Pointer Sisters song. My next attempt got me some sort of techno/rave dance beat. I am pretty sure that is not even close to Chicago Blues.

I have 4 apps I already use for varying proposes being Pandora, Grooveshark, TuneIn and 8 Tracks. This app is particularly well built and functions rather well. It's got a great UI and it's easy to understand. There's plenty of stations to listen to. Found local and international stations I'm already a fan of. All that said this app simply doesn't bring anything to the table that I don't already have the ability to do and doesn't pack enough to replace any of the apps I have. I'd recommend any of the 4 aforementioned apps before recommending this one but this is one solid app in it's own right. 4 stars!

As the days have progressed, it has gradually replaced my shortwave and hd radios with more stations to choose from and no need to play the antenna dance.Works great on the k-fire original.  Can run all day if the battery is fully charged.  I find new, enjoyable, unexpected stations almost every day.  Good sound.The only problem occurs when I fastforward too quickly through my list of saved stations.  The programme freezes.  Just restart your device and remember to wait until the station is fully buffered before moving to another channel and you'll be back to business as usual.Well worth the purchase price.  Give it a try.

It works great for listening to my favorite National Public Radio broadcasts via the west coast. The sound quality in the music broadcast from the 80s channel is not top notch. The music sounds like all the vocalists overemphesize the S sound and are sing in a long hallway.

Inconsistent as far as how challenging the levels are but not a huge deal.  For example, I will blow through like 10 levels in 5 minutes but then randomly get stuck on one for forever.  And then after that one a bunch more easy ones.  To me the game seems to easy but I still play it.  And it still gets 5 stars from me.

There are about 12 different patterns with moving parts in them that are awesome.You even get to move the little bar to make the color that you want.  I love the scrolling words... you can write what youwant it to say and it is like a billboard.  There is a moving hypnosis pattern. Blinking, rainbow, and others. You shouldcheck it out. It is a much better app than regular flashlight ones.

I DO appreciate the brightness but when I'm moving around in the house at 3am I don't want to wake everyone with a light force equal to a 747. I'm sure there will be a time when I need 100% of the product. I'm happy to have the choice.

The light is very bright and can illuminate any dark room. I even use with my DSLR camera to add some light to my pictures. The effects are fun and cool. Especially the siren in police color effect.Real cool free app with some nice custom features.

Keep in mind I use this &quot;flashlight&quot; app. on my kindles SCREEN because there is no camera hole to make a &quot;flashlight beam&quot;. So for use on my screen this app is Great.

So either I'm a better player than I think I am or the game's AI  could stand a little improvement. That said, the game is an enjoyable time killer and seems to work flawlessly without any bugs or glitches.  The operation and animation is smooth and the controls are quite easy to use on even the smallest screened smartphone.  I'll be keeping this one in my game apps....at least until I find something better.

I enjoy playing and winning, so I just use the easier levels.  Occasionally the CPU will get some strange runs of doubles but looking at the stats shows that it is not that bad.  For people really wanting a challenge, I would suggest using a high difficultly level.  It makes some pretty stupid moves, like moving pieces in the home area to a better take off position while there are still pieces outside of the home area.  But maybe the harder difficultly level corrects that.

Because of this distribution the game uses the strategy of stacking until the doubles show up to be played in the game. Not a normal strategy for a normal backgammon game.

If you have the opportunity to roll you own dice do it and if that's the case get a life, make a friend and enjoy some human interaction with a real game.

The computer has received four doubles in a row on multiple occasions... a near improbability in reality.  Either the random algorithm is flawed or it had been intentionally programmed to give the computer opponent an advantage through dice rolls at harder levels instead of more intelligent moves.  I don't think rigging the dice roles is appropriate as a means of increasing difficulty levels.  Not representative of real life at all.  Very disappointed.

Backgammon is my FAVORITE all time game.  It's easy and user friendly, if you already know how to play Backgammon.  You can choose which color you want to be (black or white) and you can pick whether you want to play from north to south or south to north. You can play the computer or a real person. There is a tutorial if you've never played Backgammon.  I highly recommend this game especially if you already know how to play!

Much better than watching the late night news!  Highly recommend this for experienced backgammon players to sharpen their skills, or for beginners to learn the moves that you should automatically think of when you throw the dice and your numbers come up.Friends have commented that my skill level is approaching deadly :)  of course, I haven't told them why.  LOVE THIS APP. almost as much as I love my Kindle Fire!

The dice rolls are a tad bit unacerate considering doubles happen a lot. I am not a huge gamer when it comes to backgammon so I love this game and I play it all of the time! My advice is to get it and try it out. If you don't like it, I mean, it's free!! ;)

Well, for the life of me, I couldn't remember how to play.  So the first stop was the help button and within a few minutes, it all came back  to me.  Whether I play the game with my husband or with the computer, it's a great way to  pass some time.  This game is easy on the eyes and the ads won't hinder your gameplay.

This free version of backgammon is easy to play, but still challenging. It seems as if the computer "learns" from my moves; at least this is how I see it and it makes the game more challenging.  I have it on my phone and Kindle Fire. Many games look too small on a cell phone, making them difficult to play, but this one is not so it makes a good diversion while waiting in line or when I am sitting around, waiting at places such as an auto repair shop or doctor's office.

(I just won 2 pts. because it didn't rake off even 1 of its chips when it could.)  I get doubles, too.  Sometimes several in a row.  It's random!  Easy to use.

It seems to give itself a disproportionate number of doubles.  Also,  it seems to dawdle at the end spending more time, and rolls, lining up it's pips in it's home area instead of bearing them off. Still an enjoyable way to spend a few minutes at a time playing a game.

Although, sometimes it really looks like the CPU is cheating, I do not believe it does.  I have beat this game so many more times than I have lost and I have played at level 4, a lot.  Plus, I have played many other backgammon computer games &amp; none compare to this one.  The higher the level the more the CPU uses classic strategy moves and it also hits your piece more, but that goes with any good board game.  All things considered this is a worth while game to down load and purchase.

Its not great and would give intermediate players wrong strategies. One thing I like, it does show players not to be too conservative. However it will double at the wrong time and take doubles it should not. I've been rated master, well 35 years ago, so I expect a lot lol. Its free, get it and learn to play, but not for serious players wanting to grow in ability.Entry level only. Well to relieve stress I play it to wipe it out. Then once in 7 series it beats me because I'm taking wild chances and because it starts throwing more doubles and getting perfect rolls. I guess there is luck, it sure gets lucky. :( I think programmed to do that once in a while.

However, I play daily and am now beating the cpu 6 of every 10 games, average. I've even gammoned it several times. If you're a competitive level player, keep searching. Graphics are nice, and I like the fact that there's directionality options, but it won't challenge you enough if you are a serious player.

I've had this one day, played maybe 10 games, and every time I've put it on the bar it gets out on the first roll.  One game it got out three times in a row when I had four covered.  And it wasn't the same spot open every time.  The 6/1, 3/1, 4/2 rolls to start the game for them and the 6/2, 6/3 rolls for me are quite regular, too.  And guess how often those open pips get hit....  Prepare to be frustrated, like with every other computer version you've played.  At least it was free.

Other than that, love it and hate it - especially when the computer seems to get doubles more often than I think I do. However, it has stats at the end of every game showing how many points each the CPU and I had, how many doubles we rolled etc. Darn if I didn't have more doubles than it did most times.Fun entertainment.

Years ago I used to play daily and entered public tournaments (we were not elite players - just players who were obsessed with backgammon).  However I have not played a lot recently and am not familiar with all the online games or other apps.  I played the app at the most difficult setting and found it worked well and was fun to play.  The app works like a full tablet sized app on my ASUS Transformer tablet.  This app looks good (not as richly colored as checkers but still nice), the pieces move smoothly (no lagging), and the board lights potential moves.  Nice app in my opinion!

You have to work at it to lose on easy. On the hardest level, a win is a victory and the dice always roll in favor of the computer.

Playing with real dice is more accurate than the computer generated dice but who wants to do that??? Not me. I'm looking for a different version that doesn't cheat as much.

And maybe it's just my tablet (a Lenovo A2109A), but it seems to be something of a battery suck.

I love having this app on my Kindle Fire. It plays smoothly, offers five levels of difficulty and and can be a challenge.I tend to play risky and most of the time it pays off. But the programming gets the best of me sometimes and I have to yell at my Kindle and tell the game is it not playing nicely. Even though I often play mean. Maybe that's why others don't want to play with me? Hmmmm.A fun app that lets you chose whether your black or white (if you chose white you have to play upside down) and offers a doubling dice.

I've found it to be very fair. On easier levels, I've received 6-9 more doubles than the CPU and on the harder levels the opposite occurs.

Haven't found that the computer was throwing more doubles for itself than for me at all. In fact on enough occasions I have thrown more doubles!  It had been a few years since I had played Backgammon and found that using this app brought all back very quickly.  On reading the directions, I believe that most anyone could learn the basics quickly and then sharpen their skills as they increase levels.  The layout is clean and clear with no clutter. I turn off the sound on all the games I play so I won't rate that.All in all I think this is a great Backgammon app!

The graphics are great plus you have options for difficulty, number of rounds in a match and it keeps track of your stats as well.  It also can show you possible moves if you are a beginner.  The game pieces are large enough that it's easy to see and use. Nicely done! As usual with free aps, there is advertisement but it is totally off to one corner and does not interfere with game play. Once in a while there is an offer to download one of their other games, but it is rare and again not a problem.

It works well on the Kindle and is definitely worth downloading if you're interested in backgammon even slightly to improve your technique or learn the game itself on a BASIC level.  Although there are 5 levels of AI skill, I found that the moves the AI performed questionable at level 5.  I would rate the maximum level of the AI skill far below any officially world recognized player.  The skill level of the AI is mediocre at best.  In response to some of the other reviewers comments regarding the frequency of doubles in this app there is 'some' validity to their statements.  However I found that the high double roll rates were divided equally between myself and the AI.  I found that the rate of doubles (normally 1 in 6 chances) was only slightly higher at 1 in 5.  With such a small margin between the two ratios I must therefore admit that the RNG (random number generator) is indeed random.If you an advanced player, or world ranked player - don't bother with this app, it will only frustrate you, as if you were playing a novice.  Although that at times can provide it's own challenges due to the unpredictability of their logic or lack of.Bottom line, worth the price of FREE.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this app worked with no problems.

Very nice game very well done highly recommend it.

After about 3 months and starting to play with a real board and real players, some problems become evident .  To increase levels of difficulty the computer just rolls statistically impossible rolls. Every time it rolls what it needs to hit an unguarded pip. Every time. And it's  strategy becomes very evident. I can predict every move from each roll.  A friend who has this app has also noticed these issues. After playing the real thing  this gets frustrating. And disappointing.  Still, it was a good way to learn and practice strategy.

I thought this app would help me practice and it has done that.  It has 5 levels of expertise, and within a couple of weeks, I have advance up to the hardest level.  The game moves quickly, but even after reading the instructions, I still am not sure what it means when a player &#34;doubles&#34; up his throw (going from 2 to 64).

While you can choose your color if you pick white you have to play upside down--the piece colors are hardwired in. There's no option for automatic double at the beginning of the game--each initial roll results in a clear winner.The authors of the game go out of their way to deny any evidence of cheating, and yet the statistics they provide would seem to belie that. After 80-odd games, the computer has rolled 10% more doubles than me, and I have been hit 30% more often than the reverse (and not for lack of trying). In other words, in the normal course of things the computer is &#34;luckier&#34; than you and will win the majority of games. However, the computer seems to be a sucker for the doubling cube and that is how I have won eight out of ten matches while losing 27 out of 50 games.

Real staticical stradederies. (as Geo. Bush would say). The game lets you concentrate on why certain moves are better than others and undo when you go astray and the algorithm smacks you down.On the next update I would and a line that says &quot;Not resigning&quot; when the game score is tied and the next game decides the match, even though its looking bad!  ie, a continue play button for fun's sake.  Compact app, plays great on my Kindle Fire.  MLawson di Ransom Canyon Rock Solid Consulting.

Difficulty is increased by the computer's ability to get the exact roll that will capture any open game piece.  Your rolls,  on the other hand, are increasingly likely to force leaving a piece open to deny your ability to cover spaces.  I'm sure that programming an AI to &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; is difficult but manipulating the dice roll as a solution is infuriating.  Also, as a general rule, if the AI asks to double, resign the game. I play the game frequently but more often than not (on the higher levels least) I will quit the game out of frustration.

I find this to be the opposite.  The computer does as well as can be expected.  I have no feeling that die rolls are better for the computer either.  The only stupid move the cmoputer makes is accepting a double when they very littel chance of winning.  This does make winning a match easier.  Just don't offer doubles in stupid situations and you can control that result.

I agree with other comments about how it seems the computer gets more doubles than I, but the handy built in stats screen shows that both players get on average the same number of doubles. What I find annoying is that the computer seems to get more favourable rolls than I do. That is to say that I seem to sit on the bench longer if a guy is captured than the computer does. Ifyour losing to poorly though you can undo and change your moves knowing you both will still get the same rolls.  Like I said I like it overall, and for free who am I to complain?

I may have to soon, though, because I am playing the game at its highest level, and I am starting to win more often than not.A note: the game seems to give more doubles and favorable rolls to the opponent. The makers assure that the random number generator is really random, and they even offer a roll-your-own option for dice. But doesn't it always seem that you are getting worse rolls when you are losing. (Probably why you are losing).The two player feature would be a good option for plane trips and the like, when you don't want to risk loosing pieces.

It isn't truly a random dice roll for the computer. If you leave a piece open, 9 times out of 10 the computer will roll exactly what is needed to cover your piece and send you back and the computer rolls an inordinate amount of high doubles, making it tough to beat. At least there is an undo feature so you can change your previous move at times.
A18OWVJ6SJ6IE0,B004DM1OAQ,0.332394366197,0.446428571429,0.0143769968051,0.0,0.113,0,TRUTHFUL,Like any other Backgammon app, this one increases the difficulty by tweaking the rolls to favor the computer. But it has some nice features for beginners.  You can take your move back even if the computer has already moved. It shows you which pieces are available to move, and where they can move, if you want it to. You can choose single games or matches with or without doubling.You can play against other people if you want to. For advanced players, this would be a convenient way to do that, but advanced players will not be challenged by the solo play. I'm advanced-beginner level and win most games at the highest level.

I keep track of my statistics and do see that the opponent gets more doubles which can be frustrating but since I consistently win more games and matches playing at the 5th level, I have to say that the game is created to let skill trump luck.  It would be a good game for novices to learn the game as well.  It's five levels give people a chance to compete at any level.

It's great to play against the computer and I love that it allows me to play against another live person (as long as they're sitting beside me!)  The computer player is pretty good, but will make a silly mistake now and then.  It's better than the PC Windows version by far.  There are also options allowing you to choose the difficulty level, and other options.  Highly recommend and it's FREE!

It doesn't take a big time investment, but she likes finding all the words and the color themes makes it more visually interesting. Just slide your finger across the screen to highlight your word.

I think it would be best for kids or senior citizens. Works well on Kindle Fire.

That makes the five levels of difficulty not really be five levels of difficulty, because the game plays the same flawed strategies at each of the five levels.In fact, I've played several computer backgammon games over the last 25 or so years, and this is unquestionably the worst AI I've yet seen.In particular, it doesn't have a clue how to best run to the inner table or how to roll off. Two games in a row when I was hopelessly out-pipped (as the AI had already rolled more doubles than odds make credible) the AI simply chose the least efficient method of filling the inner table and then rolling off. At times it will move up men on the inner table when rolling off instead of taking two men off of lower points.It will "arrange" the inner table when there are still men to bring there. In one game at the "highest" difficulty, the AI had all but two men in the inner table, and needed 12 pips to bring those to the inner table. I had three men outside the inner table and needed more than 20 pips. On two turns in a row it "arranged the inner table" instead of advancing the last two men. In the meantime I brought all three of my men to the inner table, and actually rolled off my first pair before it brought in its last two.In another game both the AI and I had all our men in the inner table, and his array was much more balanced, as I was piled up on 5 and 6. On a few turns the AI moved men up from its 5 and 6 instead of taking men off of 2 and 3. When it later rolled 5s and 6s they were wasted. I won that game without doubles, and I should have needed both double 5s and double 6s to win.This game, as do most computer backgammon games I've played, seems to roll doubles for itself at an unlikely high rate. Also, be prepared that most useful game opening rolls are going to be "won" by the AI. LOL But the AI is so clueless that it doesn't really do it any good. Note that the game will also at times accept hopeless doubles, but that is not uncommon for backgammon AIs. The only games it won were games where it considerably out-rolled me, like 40 to 50 pips worth.I played this on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 without any technical issues.Recommended if you don't want a challenge, otherwise look elsewhere.

I'd recommend the game to any fan of backgammon without reservation. However, I was very disappointed to discover after installing it that my stats from 1000+ games played in the free version weren't imported into the paid version, starting me out at ground zero. I know it seems trivial, but in an app where stats are collected it seems almost a given that the stats should carry over when you like an app enough to pay to move from the free version. I've got enough time invested in the free version that in many ways it seems more attractive to put up with the occasional ad and keep my stats than to start over again ad-free. Gotta knock off a star for this oversight.In all other respects, this is a five-star app. If you're not coming from the free version (or don't mind losing your stats if you are), consider this a five-star review and invest (if you missed getting it as the FAOTD) without reservation.

I'm not talking about &#34;bearing off&#34; there's an order to that, but when I have three five point moves and the game only allows one of them... well, it doesn't happen often but enough to cost you a star.

I enjoy board games that I can play against the computer.  (I'm not into online games, or playing with others who I don't even know.  And I usually only have a very limited amount of time to play a game, so it has to be on my time, and whenever I like.)  This version of Backgammon plays a good game -- but not the kind where you will be beaten every time you play.  (I hate computer chess games, for example.)  Of course, it's still a game of change; your success depends, to a great extent, on the &#34;roll of the dice&#34; -- literally. But in this case, that roll seems pretty fair.  And with some careful playing, I tend to win more games than I lose -- which is fine with me.

The computer is a good opponent even though some of its' moves don't always seem logical, it does give you a run for your money so to speak, and it plays fair.  The only improvement I would make on this game is to also offer the option of playing Acey-Duecy, but for the time-being I'm content with Backgammon.

It's well done, fair, altho the AI does seem to cheat sometimes. But that just makes it more challenging. And it is winnable. And sometimes in real life, the dice just doesn't go your way. If you enjoy backgammon, definitely worth the purchase. Downloaded here for my Kindle Fire HD. This company does do quality games, for sure, as I also have chess and checkers.

I do know that it can beat me on level 5 if I play irresponsibly. Of course, sometimes I get lucky. I do know enough about backgammon to know that "luck" usually favors the better player. Yes, the dice matter, but it is more about what you do with the rolls you get.I find it fascinating to read accusations that the game "cheats." I just played a game where I was way behind and rolled consecutive double 6s to get closer. I still lost, but I thought I would throw out this experience as evidence that the dice can come up with unusual rolls both ways.You just can't go too far wrong with the AI Factory games. I love their backgammon, checkers, and chess. I was thinking about buying this anyway, so I was very glad to get it as the FAOTD.

You can play 1 or 2 players, so I've even been able to teach my family members how to play. Highly recommend this one for backgammon lovers, and those who'd like to learn to play.

Very nicely done implementation of backgammon, with fast and elegant interface, nice user controls, and good documentation.  I agree with some of the other reviews that the computer opponent seems to follow a flawed strategy with its end game in that it doesn't try to get its pieces off the board as soon as possible.  Also it seems slow to double when the game is winning and quick to accept doubles when I'm winning.  All in all, it's just challenging enough for me to make it interesting at level 5.As for the random dice generator, I don't agree that the computer cheats, but it doesn't seem to have a true uniform distribution (where each of the six sides of each die is equally likely).  In one of my first dozen games it gave me the same roll three turns in a row, and it does seem to roll an awful lot of doubles.

I've been a backgammon player since my youth playing on real boards and, eventually, the internet. (Anybody else remember using telnet to connect to FIBS?)Well this certainly looks a lot better than the old telnet days. :-)  The board and dice are very nicely designed, both the classic and modern skins. I played a couple games on the different difficulty levels, and I'd say there's enough range that anyone short of a world-class player is going to find a level that is challenging and rewarding.Pros:1. Looks great.2. Free App of the Day3. 5 difficulty levels to choose from. Should be sufficient for anyone from the beginner to the serious player.4. Well worth the 99 cents...but...FREE today!5. Almost no permissions. Other than writing to storage, this thing doesn't try to do anything. I have my WiFi off when testing games, and the Single Player works without a hitch.Cons:I can't think of any.Recommendation:Get it while it's the FAOTD if you can, but if you like backgammon, it's worth the 99 cents if you miss out on the freebie.

That isn't technically buggy and they can legitimately claim to get a flat distribution over time, but it means players can cheat and therefore so can the computer.Secondly, the AI is defective. It's even worse than one I would write! That really REALLY needs fixing. Badly. It seems to have a lookahead of zero and a penchant for stacking everything on the last space. Either write a better AI (herustics, not fixed moves) or let it write its own (genetic algorithms).

Since I moved I haven't found anyone interested in learning to play. I was pleased to find this Backgammon app. The graphics are well done. The sounds and animation are pleasant and it doesn't seem to 'cheat' in the game's favor on the dice rolls. It would be nice if there were more color options for the board and pieces but other than that I've spent hours enjoying this game.

In fact, I got pretty good; winning several championship tournaments. But, that, was a long time ago. I didn't remember how to play until I got this program for my kindle fire. I like it because it comes with different levels of play as well as instructions! I am now working my way up the levels and have begun sparring with the game's computer. I'm not ready for tournaments at the local assisted-living facility, yet!  But soon!!!!

If I put the computer in the center then it always rolls the right number to put mine in the center.  Seems kind of fishy.

I tried playing it on my phone, but I guess my fingers are too fat, I had a hard time touching the pieces to move them.  After a game I gave up on this.  It is really not a limitation of the game, more than likely it's my phone. I think on a tablet it would work much better.

Some other reviews mentioned showing the possible moves takes the skill out but I found that you could easily turn that part off so use it or not as you prefer.  I keep it turned on with playing with kids because it does speed things up if they don't have to count out each move, lol.

In the last game I played, it had all its remaining pieced on 1 and 2, and rolled double ones.  It should have removed 4 from the board, but instead moved 4 from the 2 position, to the 1 position.  Stupid.  Making up for this deficiency, the computer gets better rolls.  It doesn't get more doubles, but it gets higher totals, and usually gets exactly what it needs.  Still fun, but still flawed.

The tremainder of those matches... the AI easily got 3-5 times as many doubles. While statically possible, I find improbable.Uninstalled....

I play at the hardest board and doubles are rolled constantly by the computer opponent and I had zero doubles. also on opening roll, the &#34;good&#34; rolls, ie 4/6 3/5 6/5 etc are always ALWAYS given to the computer opponent........no random play of the dice ever, and when you use the doubling cube and it appears that you have a slam dunk at winning, all of a sudden, double after double on the dice shows up when it is the opponents play......really a waste of time, takes the fun out of playing by not having a random dice play,  awful........dont waste time or money,

Aside from the fact that I don't even know anyone who wants to play the game, the invisible computer is way faster than a human. And, the AI opponent doesn't get its circuits in a bunch if you put them on the bar repeatedly. The moves available light up, and that sure makes things easy on the eyes. Since I haven't played in a while, this is a great way to get reacquainted with the game and start working my way up the difficulty levels. Lots of fun to play for 5 minutes or an hour!

I've always wanted to learn to play Backgammon, and though this app isn't really designed to &#34;teach&#34; it, it makes it very easy to learn.  The graphics are good, and the game play is quick.  There are several options that can affect the duration of a &#34;match.&#34;  You can have a quick one-game match, or you can play to 15 points, requiring several &#34;games.&#34;  After playing this, I'm ready to buy my first real Backgammon set (from Amazon, of course!).

I love to play backgammon but have found other computer versions would allow the computer to win 99% of the time, which was very frustrating. I have to say, I have out played the computer the majority of the time and if the computer wins, it is fair and square. I have it on my Kindle Fire HD and love, love, LOVE it!

It has modes that allow you to play without move tips and for newer players, has one that shows what the right moves would be.

How can you compete with that?? And not only that, the doubles were the number it could use the most to maximize moves towards a win! I'm sorry to say, but I honestly believe there is a flaw in the game that favors the device when in single player mode. If the rolls were more random, or the gameplay were more 'fair', It would definately get a higher score from me, but not the way it is. Also, one othe thing a LOT OF DEVELOPERS IGNORE ; AN EXIT BUTTON!!!!!!!  I'm not a developer/programmer, but how hard can it be? Too bad about all this, I love Backgammon!I read some of the other reviews and most people (as I do) that the dice are loaded. The roll should be as random as you can possibly make them concidering the limitations of programming. The differences should be where the AI decides to move the game pieces, leaving more open, or not, depending on the level. The dice rolls should ALWAYS BE RANDOM and have the same probability for both players. This would be the way it happens in real life with two people playing a real game. If the game ever gets updated to reflect better play conditions, my rating will go up.

With the best strat in the world it is impossible to beat that.  Nock his piece onto the bar, every time he rolls the exact number he needs to knock any of your uncovered pieces onto the bar in return. Undo to see if there is a way to cover... nope. Game just feels cheap.  Comp rolled 6 doubles in a single game to my 1.  This is common mind you.  Game is less fun when you feel like it cheats.

Opening rolls are about the only thing that follows what you might expect.  There are times it will hit every possible blot, and then other times, will not hit a blot that would be to it's advantage. The end game is ridiculous. The program wants to want to move all men to the home point FIRST - even if there are men that could be taken off a higher point. Unless I play with the doubling cube, I can easily beat the program 98% of the time at the top level. Graphics are very good, the game keeps better statistics statistics, the available moves are highlighted, and even the sound of the men 'shooshing' as they are moved are all pluses.In comparison to the Compulab game on my Kindle keyboard, no contest!But I wanted Backgammon for the Fire HD.....................Three months later.I am much more satisfied with the HD backgammon at this point. There is the feature that allows you to "undo" a move, because the touch screen can be somewhat sensitive. But you can "undo" all the way back to the beginning. I'll do that to see if a specific move was where the game fell apart. I still find the end game irritating. The statistics allow you to look at how many spaces could be moved, and the number of doubles in the game. After a total of over 700 games played on all levels, I moved my review up one star to four.

I have been playing backgammon for over 60yrs,  more than 1,000,000 games at least.  Statistics show that if you leave a spire open this app will hit you 90 / percent of the time. If you play this game as much as I do you know the statistical average is around  35 percent.  And wait until you get to a roll off,  count on the machine getting 3-4 doubles. They even have a disclaimer telling you why they are not cheating. This game is no fun.Grampyz

Level of play ranges from easy to medium, if you are professional backgammon player it will probably be too easy for you. It is, however, a good range for most.In terms of permissions, this is another great app by ai factory, which means no spyware and no intrusive permissions.

For example, when you roll doubles, you have no option to move two pieces at a time.  You have to make 4 separate moves, with each move involving at least 2 clicks.  that's 8 clicks for one move, which is too many.  Also, I started playing against the computer, with the difficulty set at 2.  Even though it's not the lowest setting, the computer played like a complete novice, passing up obvious moves in favor of idiotic ones.  Of course, this can be solved by simply setting the game at a higher difficulty, but it was still annoying.  I'll be looking for fixes in updates, so I haven't given up hope that this could become an outstanding app.

You'll not regret owning the license.* To reverse the board, after you select "Single Player," choose the dark piece (checker, pip, etc) in the "Match Settings" "Play as:" option.  To switch to white, in regular options, choose "Invert Piece Colours." This depends on who go first.

The rest of you, welcome to a type of game that was all the rage when personal computers hit the scene.In this game you have to rely on your mind alone. Using a limited vocabulary, you navigate around the world and interact with it.  Find items to use, treasures to hoard, puzzles to solve, etc. It's an adventure, so the more you explore and discover, the more points you get.  Thankfully, you can pause the game and come back to it later when you need to, and can continue to play should your game self be killed (costs you points)If you're looking for flashy graphics and super fast gameplay, skip this one.

It is one of the first things I went looking for when I got my tablet (an archos 70)... but I have not, yet been able to put it on my archos 5 because of lack of market access (I will try downloading to that device later now that Amzon has it, but it works fine on the archos 70!)Writing this review makes me feel old indeed.  I spent so many night awake until all hours of the night playing this on my dad's apple 2c back in 1975,6,7... it is a very rich game and one you will not finish in an hour or a day.  This is the game which spawned an entire genre (or 2 or 3): rpgs, text adventures, d & d sims... they all started here.So far this port seems very true to the original; at least I have not found a place where it deviates (but for the addition of voice control, if that is available/ enabled on your device).  I have not used that component (I would feel very odd sitting in a waiting room, e.g. and talking to my tablet) but the text component is true to the original.Colossal cave takes you on a grand adventure underground: dragons, pirates, and other slithery things :)  I would not want to spoil it for the uninitiated by giving a blow by blow.  I will just say that this is definitely worth downloading!  You can't get much more "retro," as this is the first of its kind.  if you grew up with games which are heavy on the graphics... well you are missing something in terms of engaging your imagination.  Give this a try.  What have you got to lose? (other than hours and hours and hours.... heh heh heh).

At the time, it was one of the most fascinating computer games available.  And its long life -- and the fact that I'm playing it again almost 40 years later -- support the fact that this is the greatest adventure game of all time.  There is a fascination with something that at first appears so simple, yet without "awesome graphics" or "3-D whiz bangs" or any other "modern gaming devices", and is still challenging and enjoyable.The game is implemented well, and I highly recommend it -- especially to younger players (by which I include anyone under about 35!) -- as a wonderful break from the fast and furious trigger-finger mindless destruction games that are so prevalent today.

I know that it adds to the challenge but if and when I do want to leave, I get even more lost.

If it's complicated puzzles don't get you, the random holes that seem to appear in dark areas will. Or better yet, try getting out of the labyrinth while keeping your sanity.

These days, graphics in games are the norm.  If you want an experience that's different than all the third-person shooters, then try this out.  It's very basic with its vocabulary, but if you can manage to get into it, it's a very enjoyable and very vivid adventure because the graphics are all in your head.  It's one of the best relics of interactive fiction.  Infocom games started out soon after this and are very similar.  It's a lot like Zork I, but a little different.

What seemed pretty cool (which I got for free app day) wasn't too helpful at all. All the numbers are kind of in a really bland and un-aesthetically pleasing format.

The app is called calorie counter, but it doesn't count anything. It simply allows you to pick a restaurant, look at a list of menu items, and touch each item to see its nutritional values. No pictures, no way to add up the various items to total up the meal, no way to keep track of your history to try to reduce calorie intake and raise protein intake... nothing particularly useful.This was most disappointing when looking at the list of ingredients at chipotle. It lists out the tortillas, chips, salsa, meat, cheese, beans... etc. But no way to build the burrito or plate to know what you're about to eat. I am not a developer, but there is no way this feature would be difficult to add.Lastly, I should be able to enter my calorie intake goals and be able to see where most of my calories come from. Without this feature, it is just an app full of raw data. I am almost certain that I can find all of this information on a single website if I googled it. I really got my hopes up on this app and I can't believe anyone would pay $3 for this raw and freely available information.This app has potential to be extremely useful. Most of my meals come from local restaurants. Add these features and I might just pull out my phone for something other than words with friends during my meal.

For $3?  It's lucky to get even 1.They seem to have left out a number of places, like IHOP (they have Denny's, though), Taco Johns, Papa Murphy's and Golden Corral (though they have Old Country Buffet).It also just displays nutritional info, but it lacks the ability to put together a whole meal and get a total of all those numbers.There are free apps that do a much better job of calorie counting than this one.

The major places are covered of course, along with some various other places I'm not familiar with. If the dev continues to add to this list, it could prove to be a very extensive resource!The ability to sort by macronutrient or name is very cool. Good idea.The inclusion of some of the chain restaurants that aren't fast food would be very nice. I see applebees is there so it looks to be in the works.A utility in the program to request restaurants to add or even reference sources such as a url or something to make it easier for the dev to find and add more places would be icing on the cake.Cool application. I hope to see it grow.  For the health conscious out there, it's a no brainer on this free day!  (Thanks Amazon!)

There's no saturated fat listing, items can't be combined to make a meal, and the Chipotle section doles out the info piece by piece. So you have to check the salsa, then the steak, then the cheese... and add it all up in your head.  Uninstall.

For instance, if you look at Chipotle on the app, you can see the beans and the rice and everything's nutritional facts but unless you're writing it all down and adding it all up, you have no general idea of the nutritional facts of the burrito you're about to eat.  And by "nutritional facts" I mean fat, protein, calories, fiber, and carbs since that's all they give you.  Glad I didn't pay for it.

I concur with the critical reviews this has been getting.  This has a decent # of restaurants and the ability to sort by various fields (calories, etc.), but definitely needs way more. It doesn't actually count anything; you can't change menu items to subtract items like mayo(which many websites do); there's no real size selection; it is missing key details like saturated fat, sodium, & sugar; other reviews have noted inaccuracies & that it is out of date on some items; needs app 2 sd card; it should also have a "favorites" option for restaurants & menu items for quick look-up. Clearly an app like this is much-needed, but this doesn't fill the void. Other reviewers suggested My Fitness Pal, Calorie Counter & MyNetDiary apps; I'm going to check them out.

It does nothing to count your calories for you. Now I could see it being handy when you're in a fast food joint and need to check the calories in your meal, because it is quicker than searching online.  This application is worth nothing more than 99 cents and would be better being free and ad supported.

However, it is certainly not worth $2.99 for a few reasons.Pros: Easy to pick icon driven restaurant chooser. No ads.Cons: Only has 71 restaurants. Once you select the restaurant you get a basic menu driven list like most other apps. Only displays calories, fat, carbs, fiber and protein. So there is no report of saturated fat, vitamins, or other useful info. It only displays one item at a time, so adding up a meal would be a very arduous process that would require pen, paper, and probably a calculator. I could actually go on and on.Summary: Basically, there are a lot of other apps that do a better job, provide more information, are more useful, easier to use, and all around higher quality.

If you do choose from the list you don't get to choose sizes. If you happen to get the only size, it still doesn't count for you, it's just a lookup.Ultimately that's what this app is, a simple online menu lookup for some restaurants with only one size and no descriptions.There is a search feature, but really it's just a filter, you can't search across menus for instance.The first free app of the day where I'm sad that even though it was free to me Amazon is paying the dev 1/5th list price. Sorry Amazon.

I'm glad I picked this up for free and didn't pay the $2 for it.  I'll still keep it, and probably refer to it, but the interface is not all that great to work around and I really wish it would allow you to look at several food items at once so you can see everything.I do appreciate that it is more than calories, knowing how much fat, protein, carbs, and fiber is also useful.I hope they update this app, I would like to see it become more than it is.

While this app does not include certain resteraunts such as Red Robin (as some have complained about) we must keep in mind that this is a Fast Food calorie counter. The fact that places like Bob Evans and Chipotle are even on this list are a bonus.As for the fast food selection, it is darn good. I dont have one fast food place in my area that is not listed. They even go into detail by showing calories for individual condoments!I would have rated this 4 because I too would have liked to see an adding capability within this app but since so many people felt it necessary to give 1's just for missing that small part, I want to give it a 5 to boost up its overall rating because this is not a bad app. Like I said it is competing with calorie look up books that do the same thing for 3 times the price. Normally a great deal but today its a steal!

Well, they're right on about this one.There's one single good thing about this app, &amp; that's the fact that you can sort a restaurant's menu by calories or fat, or any of the other 5 or so ways they have listed. The only time I eat at any of these places is if I'm with someone else who really wants to eat there. So, if you're like me, this might be useful if you're looking to find the least fattening thing on the menu to eat. Regardless, it won't add up menu items for you, so you're going to be adding it up on your own if you want to know how much your whole meal is worth. This would be especially tedious if you were getting a salad, for example, as the dressing, croutons, etc. are listed separately &amp; would have to be added up separately.  Add the fact that they don't usually have all sizes listed, &amp; this app just becomes basically useless.It's a pain sifting though their lists no matter how you sort them. Not all restaurants are listed. When you find your restaurant, not all items or sizes are included. You can't add up menu items. The list could go on &amp; on. Plain &amp; simple this app sucks. They should be ashamed to charge people for this thing, &amp; I'm almost positive you could find a free one that's much more complete &amp; user friendly. For free it's an incomplete list I still won't waste my phone memory on. If it's a work in progress, then give it for free or don't release it until it's done.Restaurants have dietary info available that you can ask to see, or you can get online &amp; see it. Either way, you'll get a better list than this app gives you. Or, do yourself a favor &amp; don't eat fast food. Once you get used to eating healthy, you don't need a list or a calorie counter to help.

Doesn't do anything you would expect of a &quot;calorie counting&quot; app. You would hope it would let you add up items or something, but no. I guess you could look things up and write them down and then add up the calories later, but that defeats the purpose of such an app.

Not sure if thats because other calorie counting apps have set the bar so high, or because this one is just that bad. The list of restaurants is extremely short. The app doesn't look like anything special, considering the dev's want money for it. It lacks so many features, features that every other app of this category have. There should be some sense of customizing meals. Even if they didn't go above and beyond, selecting 1 standard size for each item is ridiculous. Some of these fast food sites even let you build your meal and see the totals. Honestly, this is a poor excuse for a calorie counting app. Don't waste your time.Phone: Droid X(Android 2.2.1, Liberty 2.0.1)

Almost every single one of these restaurants already has this information on their web sites, and most of those allow you to build a meal so that you can actually COUNT calories.This app is also sorely lacking in food and restaurants. The Arby's Angus Three Cheese and Bacon is missing, and I've been seeing commercials for that for several weeks now. Plus the restaurant Zaxby's isn't listed at all.Honestly this would be tolerable were this a free app, it really wouldn't be worth. 99, but frankly for the dev to charge 3 bucks for this is just downright insulting.

The text area cleared. Obviously, the screen should be able to be rotated without losing the text. The only reason this app gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because this is the only fault I have found...it spell checks well and all that but...the frustration from being unable to rotate it gives this 2 stars.

It's a little unclear at the end of the game to tell exactly how you did on the high scores page, but I noticed that the score line highlighted is your correct score.

I don't like how the advertising is located conveniently too close to the &quot;roll&quot; bar, the dice (as you try to highlight them), and the options tab at the bottom of the screen.  I have accidentally hit the ad countless times and had to back out numerous. times in the middle of a game.  (KFire)  I also dislike that extra 5 of a kind cannot be counted as a score for a full house.iI give it 2 stars because the actual gameplay is pretty quick.Going to uninstall to see if I can't find one I like better,  or at least one that doesn't have gameplay functions literally on top of ad links.  I got a FAR better Yahtzi game on a CD out of a cereal box!

Works great on the Kindle Fire, I've had no problems with the app.  I wish it had multi player capability but my wife plays it on her Fire and I play on mine and we compare scores.  I like the features of being able to move an item places in case you tap the wrong field.  The color change in the options is nice but it will sometime revert back to the original color then change to the color scheme you selected.Overall it's a fun app if you like playing Yahtzee.

The ads don't bother me, but the screen response now has a delay that didn't exist before.  Makes it very difficult to highlight the dice you want to keep from a roll.

It's very basic without a lot of &#34;glitz and glamor&#34; of other kindle games - but it is an easy way of playing Yahtzee.  I do miss the option though of using a second 5 of a kind as a wild (like you can in the Yahtzee game).  Otherwise, it's the basic Yahtzee.

If you mistakenly drop the dice on the wrong entry you are stuck. And sometimes when you hold say three dice and then draw another two the dice don't appear to change but you loose your turn. Too many quirks!

I also miss having an opponent. The sound effects are ok. What I do like is the quickness of each game. It is helpful too when it gives you hints about where to put your score. Makes for less thinking. I can whip out game after game, but it takes away from enjoyment. It's a good game to play if you are just trying to pass a few minutes of time. Glad it was free.

It works fast and accurately on my lower end tablet and the interface is simple, but attractive. I love the musical tones when you "hold" a die and I love the sound when you "roll" the dice. The ability to change the colors of the game just adds to its appeal for me. I'm rocking my own little pink game of yahtzee AS I TYPE THIS. Then I'm going to head over and buy the paid version.

Seeing the lighted and darkened portions of the globe move across the screen, watching weather develop and move across the oceans and the land and more are an ever-changing  treat.  I really am glad that I've gotten this.

I was amazed at how fast this app installed, I expected it to take longer because of the incredibly detailed images. All views are gorgeous on the Kindle Fire. Took me a couple of seconds to figure out how to get back to the view I wanted, but now that I have it figured out, I'm having no problems navigating around the app. Well worth the price. The only thing that doesn't seem to work on the Kindle Fire is the "keep Earth stable as device is rotated." Although it could be that I don't understand that feature.

This is a logic game where you are trying to move the red car to the exit.  Sounds easy, right?  It is not, but that is the fun part.  You must try to move the other cars so the red car can move.  It is fun and challenging.  My sons (7 y.o.) love this game and I think it is great for them to play a fun, thinking game.  I would recommend this game to anyone looking for thinking game.I have seen other reviews about privacy issues and I do not know about that.

Big mistake - the app ran really slow, then even slower, then hung the phone completely. The only recourse at that point was too pull the battery and restart.  Some may think one star is unfair, given that the app is merely (not) performing as advertised, but there's really no excuse for this kind of behavior on one of the most popular Android platforms.

I am just a user who appreciates a good puzzle game... unless the developers are too lazy to make their app compatible with popular devices! shame on you concrete! 0 stars if I could! come back when you learn to work out apps for all droid devices, especially the most popular ones!!!

The permissions in the Amazon store version include read and write access, opening network slots, and accessing information about networks. The same app in the Google Market version also asks for information about phone calls, and accesses your phone ID. This is the *same* app with less permissions - why? Obviously the developer was worried that the app wouldn't pass Amazon's reviewers, since it looks like the developer really wants your phone info (why? To sell, would be my guess). So you download this app and soon after you are alerted that there is an update. Of course, the update might be a great way to revert the app to the original permissions that were specified in the Market version.Guess what happens when you update the app.

Growing very tired of excessive invasion of privacy esp. for stuff like puzzles and games. Bad enough you have to give permission to important apps and utilities. No longer will I download any apps asking for the same types of permissions using excuses like feint and leader boards, bug reports, e-mail, all of it. Just a poor excuse to have access to data of value to sell & make up for lack of people buying the apps. Every single dev says they dont use the data they can access or make it available to data miner companies. So who is responsible for all the massive data stealing through apps? Nobody, so it must be the Spyware Fairy.

An application with this permission can determine the phone number and serial number of thisphone, whether a call is active, the number that call is conncted to and the like.* Storage - modify/delete USB storage contents modify/delete SD card contents - Allows an application towrite to the USB storage. Allows an application to write to the SD card.* Hardware controls - control vibrator - Allows the application to control the vibrator.* Network communication - view network state - Allows an application to view the state of all networks.* view Wi-Fi state - Allows an application to view the information about the state of Wi-Fi. (network comm.)Anyone who looks at the Market versions can clearly see those permissions are way out of wack to run a "car version" of the Block Me game, especially the Market's PAID version.  The developer wants ALL those permissions in BOTH free and paid versions, so in the paid version, you're paying for "more game" and not "less/no ads."  The developer clearly doesn't care about giving you more "game" for the money, because he has no intention of changing the unbelievably invasive permissions that are the poster child for data mining.Now the developer faces Amazon.  He knows asking for your phone's ID and serial number and a list of all the numbers of who you call, and who called you, are going to pop right out to Amazon reviewers as the BIG CLUE that he is data mining.  So he takes it out.... but he leaves in the others and hopes those permissions gets defended as necessary for that wonderful "leaderboard action" and "rate this app" and "notify me of bugs" stuff, as so many unknowing Amazon reviewers DO have a habit of doing to justify keeping the free app they don't want to part with.READ THE PERMISSIONS YOURSELF and YOU decide how the developer makes a living off this app, what he did to get onto Amazon FAOTD, what all those permissions on the Amazon version add up to (even WITHOUT the phone serial number request), why phone information is wanted by the developer on all other versions but this Amazon one (for now), and what he'll likely do to update YOUR app once he's out of the Amazon spotlight.If you doubt the developer will add the phone stuff back, just go right here on Amazon and look at any of the other 16 apps this developer put out here, for instance the "paid" version of Bubble Popper.  The permission for the phone is IN there, even in that PAID version.P.S.  Misspellings in an app itself realllllllly get me nervous as to who is developing these apps and why, especially considering the massive phone ID serial numbers theft originating from Asia. Why they can't get or don't want an English-speaking American to look it over first before marketing to America makes me cock my eyebrow in a BIG way.

It is a fun, spacial puzzle game that has always challenged and entertained me. I hesitant to pick this up but then decided to give it a shot. I **LOVE** the graphics. I've never seen one look this good. The cars take on a more 3D tone than the other games I've tried.If you like this type of puzzle game, or are looking for a puzzle game to play, then you might want to try this one out.

It has great effects, challenging levels, and a count of moves so you can try to beat your best solution for each puzzle.  I couldn't think of anything that would make it any better.  Well worth whatever price.

Well I played a version of this game as a kid... I spent hours getting good at it... it is a wonderful game of mental gymnastics as you move the cars around... it is a wonderful game filled with good memories of playing as a kid... it is still a great challenge ...  my goal is always to do the puzzle in less than a minute... easy for the first 10 puzzles....

Unforantly the graphics were poor on the ten inch screen. The author of this game did a great job on improving the graphics in this version.  Ironically my phone is a Droid Razr so per the developer's comments, I can only play this on my tablet and play the other version on my phone. Overall it is great game regardless of the eye candy and I highly recommend it for all ages. (Toshiba Thrive 3.2.1)

If your playing on a Kindle Fire, as I am what data can they get? Also if your worried just disable Internet access before starting the game.  Believe me, it is well worth any small effort just to play this game.  To all you yelling about this being a copy of other games like Blockme,,, almost every game is a copy of the one that came before it.  It's called innovation or improvement.  Paranoia is sometimes a good thing but this is just a game and an easy workaround for any phone users.  I would readily put this as one of the most brain teasing and fun games on Amazon.  jmho

Each level is not easy and there are 480 puzzles to play and each one gets harder.  I played for over an hour and I really thought this game concept was unique and fun to play. It reminds me of being trapped in Manhattan in grid lock and trying to get to the airport to catch a flight.Based on game play it is a 5 star rating, based on violating my privacy is should be a Zero star rating!Now the bad part, why does a simple game app need access to my Kindle Fire data?  Here are the permissions that it asks for access to:* Storage (OK)* Network Communication (not OK)* Kindle calls for Kindle state and Identity (not OK)* View network state (not OK)* View WIFI state (not OK)* Hardware controls to control vibrator (OK)There is no good reason why any app needs my Kindle state and ID.  This is another app that either collects the data for themselves or for the tooling software company who developed the app development software.Such programs are under investigation now by 35 State Attorneys General who are asking the five major app selling distributors (Including Amazon) to require the app developers to disclose their privacy policies before their services are installed on a device.  At question is the ability to pull sensitive information from your device and use it themselves or resell it to other companies.Most app developers have not even drawn up privacy policies as they believe that they are outside of a 7 year old law governing online privacy.  Such apps can drill into your address books and other personal files on smart phones and tablets.  The states feel that most people rightfully do not want that to happen and don't even know that it is going on inside of their device.The Federal Trade Commission has released a study that indicates that the app makers are collecting data even about children and violating federal laws.The answer is not a 10 page publication regarding the app makers privacy policy, the answer is simply, "DO NOT COLLECT MY PRIVATE DATA FOR ANY REASON!"  Writing a privacy policy may make some app makers think twice about misusing data but how will that protect the consumer when the app developer is overseas and out of reach of the federal and state laws and jurisdictions?For the above mentioned reasons I give this app 1 star as that is the lowest I can go.  Please stop putting data collection software onto my personal and private devices!

This bread and butter gets straight down to brass tacks and let's solve a billion puzzle scenarios in order to get that corvette back to wall street yuppie.  my only pita with this game is it needs a storyline,  something exciting.  heck maybe some bonus levels where you have to put it in a certain spot.

But it is a puzzler. Each level gets more difficult of course but if you get stuck you can just move on and go back to it later. It also keeps your score for each level so you can go back and try to beat it. This is the game I play when I want to relax, after Angry Birds gets my blood pressure up LOL.

No? Maybe if you are God. This seems to be a puzzle game for God, as it is nothing we humans can relate to.Would be better if it were a bit more realistic and put blocks or a host of other things than cars.If you are God and can relate to this, then its not a bad game, but very simple and has no depth. Special abilities, new mechanics, etc.

I'm glad I gave it a try anyway. Can't figure out why anyone would rank this low, unless it just didn't work on their tablet or phone. Works great on Kindle Fire. Sort of difficult to put down, once I start playing the puzzles. Both in our family have enjoyed it already. I think this game is better on a tablet than paying 20 bucks for the plastic pieces and game cards for the board game.

You might almost call it addicting. :-) It is a decent puzzle game, but somehow it feels a bit overdone. Can a game be too flashy or frilly?Regardless, this game will keep you occupied. I haven't played any of the other traffic puzzle games to give an accurate comparison. But, if you like puzzles or puzzle games you won't be disappointed getting this one as Free App of the Day. Whether it's worth paying for compared to the free alternatives, I can't say.

Many game apps lack this, making it difficult to play them.For those asking why &quot;the permissions&quot;? It's for sharing of your high scores online,  IF you chose to do so.If you like strategy type game puzzles then, I recommend giving this one a try.

My son is 2 and loves learning about the colors and numbers at the same time. I love that it has puzzle fruit, counting how many fruits go into the lunchbox, plus he's learning his small to biggest, and even his color groups. May not be a lot to some people, but it makes a little difference to a little person that loves learning everyday. I love this game for him and I have seen that he is learning a lot everyday.

When we got them Kindle Fires, we downloaded it and away they wnt. They already know how to play and they so enjoy earning their stickers.

She has been playing this for about three weeks now, and I have noticed a drastic increase in her cognition- she is now able to keep focused and learn her numbers, colors, and different fruits. The fun monkey makes noises, keeps her engaged, and makes her laugh. The app has counting, matching, puzzles, colors, and a sticker feature as rewards. When she is done with her exercises, she loves picking out her sticker to "put on the paper" to show her mom and dad. It is so entertaining that the 6 and 9 year old want to play it lol. Great app and I'm so happy I found it!

After every few screens it asks you to pick a sticker to add to a page of stickers that you have earned.  The stickers accumulate until you exit the app.  Then they are gone.My toddler is really fascinated by this app and often asks to play with it.  The activities in this game are perfect for his level of development right now.I really like that it uses healthy fruit, not candy or other junk food.  There is so much junk food everywhere in our society that it is refreshing to see a game that encourages healthy eating.The only thing I don't like about this app is that it takes up a lot of space on my phone.  But I clicked on "move this to my SD card" and now there's plenty of space, and the app plays fine from there.(I don't have any connection with the makers of this game.  I'm just a satisfied customer.)

The screens are high definition, colorful and the animation is well done. The point of the game is to complete a set of three challenges in order to be rewarded with the child's choice of a sticker. Then repeat. The challenges range from counting to matching colors or fruits to a simple puzzle to memory games. They rotate randomly. All the while a cute little monkey dances on the screen when your child is successful.It is easy enough for my 2yr old and captivating enough for my 5yr old. It works well on all my devices from Thunderbolt to Galaxy Tab to Bionic.Well worth the cost.

Overall a really nice app that is toddler and preschooler friendly. As mentioned before, only the home button works. I understand keeping it simple, but options such as volume on/off, difficulty level, etc would be nice. Too easy for older kids, too hard for younger, fits a very narrow age and skill range.With a little refining this app would be worth purchasing. Until then it is a honestly a little expensive.3 stars for current version and price4 stars if price drops to $0.99 or app is updated.

Exciting for 2 to 5 year olds.  The program constantly moves along keeping the child's interest while teaching them shapes, colors, matching, logic puzzles, and differences (big vs. small, etc.).  Well done and worth every penny! (Note to parents - turn the volume down as the background music gets annoying fast.)

After about 10 minutes of play they begin to repeat.  As you move through the games there is no escalation in difficulty or any apparent attempt to select the "next" puzzle based on previous puzzles or the child's success at solving them.In our case my 4-year old daughter got bored even before the first sequence was completed.  A little ways after the puzzles began to repeat she closed the app and wanted to watch a movie.On the plus side, this app is "solid" (no bugs and with a finished appearance).  It also does *not* need any kind of Internet connection to run.  (Some reviewers said it did and I expect they may have been using an earlier version.)  Finally, it runs just fine on my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet.In summary, it is good for at least one fairly short sitting.

Graphics are cool, as are the sticker rewards.Bad: It does get repetitive at times, so a few more challenges or variety would be nice.  Also, it turns off your screen saver as well as your ability to exit the app, so the only way to stop it is to turn off the phone, turn the phone back on, and then kill it, so it's murder on your battery life.

The rating gets reduced exclusively for the lack of progress save.  Why collect stickers if you lose them by the wrong press of a button?

This one fits the bill and it is fun. There is counting, matching, size differentiation, colors, letters, and puzzles. Plus, at the end you get a *sticker*. Ages 2-4 will be best suited for this app. Fun learning is always a good thing.

Unfortunately, the apparently random nature of the challenges being offered do now allow a child to progress from easy to hard problems in the various categories.

I gave it four stars because there is no option to work on one kind of game at a time.To all the teenagers that rated the app one star because they are mad it is a kids game, get a life.  You need to rate apps based on their quality in that category and for giving the user what it said it would. This is for adults to entertain their children with. And I really wish everyone would stop whining about amazon, it is old, this isn't a forum for you to bit.. about amazon and what free app they are giving you, it is a place to rate said app.

Interface is pretty solid, colors are bright, voices are annoying; all the things that hold a child's attention. I feel this does a good job of teaching simple shapes, colors, and counting.Basically this is a collection of mini games for your little one. Every few mini games, it rewards you with a sticker, which you paste on a wall and immediately go back to mini games. Shape puzzles are smooth and easy for my three year old, counting is maybe a little automated as it doesn't encourage you to follow along as it counts when you tap the fruits. It is educational until your little angel can count to 20 on his or her own, but even then it's entertaining and anything that buys me an extra ten minutes of peace at the grocery store check-out is worth two bucks!

The games include things like puzzles, a matching game, finding the biggest or smallest item.  The games cycle through and after 5-6 games the kid gets to pick a sticker to put on their sticker board.  Cute animations and fun music.

There are different activities, yes, simple puzzle, colors,  letters and a few more - however you cannot pick what you want to play as they are randomly set up and delivered in groups of 5-6 games or so per round of play -after each round you get a little sticker to place on a board - stickers are cute and fun idea - however they are not saved (no option)  and you start with blank board each time you begin play --would have been better if u could keep the stickers in a little album or something. - After about 5 rounds of playing I noticed games were repeating,  after about 10 rounds my daughter noticed - just not enough variety or options for a paid app - or an app for kiddos with minimal attention spans!!! I use on Kindle Fire and as with other reviews I read I do not have to be connected to Wifi to play- can play in car, on the go no prob.

Both my 3 year old and 5 year old enjoy it.  It has a few different game modes (find the biggest/smallest, drag to complete a puzzle, place stickers, find all objects of the same color, counting, and a small memory-type game).I haven't had any technical issues with it on my Thunderbolt or XOOM.  Hopefully a future update will bring a broader set of objects and games (I'm worried that the kids will tire of the small set of images and sounds).

It is essentially the same few pages of activities that rotate through, then at the end of each set they get to pick out stickers to put on a board -- well you know kids love stickers! I think that is their motivation for completing the activities. Activities include color sorting, counting and putting puzzles together.

I downloaded it when my grandchild was not yet three and she loved it.  It has a variety of games having to do with colors, counting, etc.  It lets them pick a sticker when they get so many correct and a board to stick them on.  A really cute game and it is random as to what game is coming up next so you do not get sick of any one thing. I would recommend.

Just because you aren't happy with the free app chosen doesn't mean you should negatively rate the app, which only harms the developer.

I don't know what draws her to it, if it's the graphics or the sounds, but she did learn how to match objects for other games I got later based on this one.  At 2 years old, this game drove her to figure out how to understand matching fruit and with other games she never really cared.  I don't like the short 10-second recycled music song that constantly plays (it's not annoying, just too short), but the animation works well and it has a lot of variety.  Great job on the developer part for getting this "formula" right.

She lost interest after a few rounds.  BUT, I would not dismiss this app because children learn differently, and your child/grandchild may have hours and hours of enjoyment from learning from all the puzzles/games.  The monkey is fun to watch by itself as well.  A great buy and well-worth it!

It was a bit on the easy side for her and she has since gone on to other apps.There are other reviews that tell exactly what this app does.  It can be a nice fun learning opportunity for a child.Grandaughter does like earning the stickers!UPDATE:  2 year old triplets first time on my phone. Not everything was mastered the first time, but they loved this app!!Update:  After using this probably twice a week for 6 weeks or so, the triplets have totally mastered this.  While they still enjoy it for a short time, they are moving on to other apps.  Would love suggestions for suitable apps to try.

A fellow teacher had her son and mother-in-law with her at school one day.  My grandson is the same age as her son.  We were talking about apps and games for our three-year-olds.  Her mother-in-law recommended this game.  I got it for my grandsons (both age 3) to play when visiting. After my son saw it he purchased it for his son.  It is educational, fun and they learn to play it as they go.  This should be a must on every tablet, computer or other device if you have preschoolers.

He is a bit old for most of the content and since he has been in Preschool since he was 2, finds this a little boring. Less repetitive content would be better and as a few have said, save features would be nice and ability to keep home keys locked out during play so they don't exit accidentally would have earned out another star.

What I like about these games are that they help with counting skills and matching games that the Jumpstart games do not provide.  In addition, the puzzle game in Monkey Preschool is much easier to pick up; in the Jumpstart puzzle game you are allowed to pile puzzle pieces on top of each other and on top of the pattern so that key clues are covered.  With the Monkey Preschool, the pieces snap back to the pickup pile and do not become piled up so all the pieces are out in the open and easy to compare with the pattern.  Although the Jumpstart games are a lot of fun, the Monkey Preschool games have an overall edge in ease of learning the concepts and in the breadth of skills.

The colors are bright, the content is good, and it holds my sons attention really well.  Only warning to parents is that the sound is very lively and can get grating after a while (can be mitigated by turning the volume down of course.) Runs great on Atrix and Samsung Galaxy S II.

It also said stepped, and as I was going to tell my mom, I stepped in the chips! Another experience I had, I was on the couch, and my mom said to my baby sister, oh I need to change you! I had the radar on and it said, diaper and stink, and my sister stunk! So, if you believe in ghosts, get it! If you don't maybe you will! This is a 100 star worthy app!

It could just be plain cooincidence too. Either way, ask your friends about personal ouija board experiences. Using Ouija boards have been reported to cause anything from hauntings to possesion, and honestly what is a ouija board but cardboard with numbers and letters drawn on it? My point is, using things for the intent of talking to otherworldly creatures might bring trouble your way...especialy on a computer program like this. Also, the battery life issues are probably just the program using alot of power, but ghosts reportedly drain battery power, so it could be a sign of true activity if the power gets low while getting accurate word hits.

I'm a truck driver and i downloaded this app while i was sitting in a shop parking lot. the first thing it said was parts. then it said p and kept putting the letter p across yeah i really had to bad. i went to find an mt trailer and it said flat and research. didn't. find a flat but when i checked inside trailer i found a huge hole in the roof. if I'm to believe what they say there were a few ghosts around too. I do believe in ghost but i'll have to do a little more researching to see if this is really a reliable ghost detector. all in all it is an interesting app.

I don't know if it is real but some things it says are just too relevant. Get it and try and see what you think. I got this one and liked it so much I moved on to the $1.99 upgrade and I am very pleased with all the extras it has. I still use this one. My friends are really interested to see it. This version is easy to use. I said some things after I asked a question, and they were right on the money. Creeepy!

According to the radar, I had like 6 ghosts in my house. They started saying stuff that didn't make sense. But seeing those words and looking at the radar scared the s*** out of me. Because I'm a believer, this scared me so badly, I'm afraid to use it again. The only reason I want to use it still is so I can maybe communicate with my dad. Only 4 stars because it's so freaky.

I didn't believe that spirit stuff could be THAT crazy or dramatic. Some kids at my middle school believe I'm psychic. I sometimes see things, I sometimes hear things, and when I wake up in the morning after a dreamless sleep, I have (a) scratch(es). I'm not sure if I'm going then myself or there is some sort of spirit who likes or hates me. I've watched Celebrity Ghost Stories in the past but I stopped when I entered 5th grade two years ago. Now, as a seventh grader, I'm not interested in this stuff anymore. I got this app to see how fake it was. Our parents were asleep so we (my sister and I) thought that was close to&quot;alone&quot; so I turned this on. We have had many pets before. They all died except one that I set free. When I started my homework, I saw a blue dot kind of behind-ish and right-ish. I looked at where you see communication and it said. I said hi and how are you. I said if you want me to turn it off to not die yourself. Nothing appeared so I kept my saying and came into here. This is a great app.Ooh! Just now I realized a dog died next door. When I said &quot; Bailey&quot; two dots appeared. More coming soon!

STOP CALLING THEM GHOSTS! I don't know why, but I feel like I'm disrespecting them when I call them ghosts. So I call them spirits. Anyway...A red dot showed up at the very top of the screen. It looked like it was pointing at the house across our street. Then, it said &quot;MARK&quot;. That freaked me out, because a few years ago, a guy named Mark used to live in that house.

One time my Nana was cleaning the house, and I turn this app on while she was vacuuming. Then a red dot appeared and the word &quot;Attempt&quot; popped up. A second later the word &quot;organization&quot; appeared. I thought about my Nana cleaning the house and that attempt organization means clean house. After that &quot;wherever&quot; popped up and I thought it was saying clean the house wherever it needs to be cleaned. I think this app is pretty cool!

I had just gotten out of the shower, talking to my husband, naked I might add, and the word "Beautiful" came up. Now I could flatter myself and think it was talking about me but I just brushed it off then I had to give my husband Insulin, 2 shots which he doesn't like very well and was grumbly about it, when I was through I looked at my Kindle and another word popped up, "Necessary" Coincidence? I don't know but it is very entertaining and I would recommend it for entertainment purposes.

Whether if this app &#34;works&#34; or not, it is entertaining and surprizing with the words it picks up.

And sometimes it'll say random things like 'kite' and 'child' when neither of those things are around. so I'm skeptical as to whether or not this is real or for just entertainment purposes...nonetheless, it's creepy when it's accurate.

The words that it says are completely random; ask it a questions and you will get something illogical.

It kept me staring at the screen and wondering when I'll see another ghostie or hear something. I've seen several different types of ghosties and heard 'ancient', 'through', 'he'd' and 'syllable'. But seriously people, do you expect to get a free ghost finder thingy? Don't get mad if it doesn't work like you want it to and carry on a conversation with you.

Of course, this app probably deserves a few more 5 star reviews considering that some kids thought it was a game. Its pretty cool, freaky, and sent chills up my spine. As people offered me to go walk, I declined. I then turned on the radar, and caught 2 words: didn't, walk. Creepy, but extremely interesting. Probably useful for freaking out friends, family, or little kids.

Eerily relevant responses from &quot;the unseen realm&quot;! Seriously, though, I bought this as a lark, expecting very little. However, within minutes of starting the radar, I was quite unnerved by some of the words coming through.Also, I know plenty of Kindle Fire users are complaining about not having a microphone to pick up voices, but I find that to be a benefit, as the app can't confuse random surrounding sounds as possible voices. O simply explain out loud that any entity that wishes to communicate can simply use the Kindle to speak to me. I have had very impressive sessions with different people, and different locations, each situation having different interactions, and outcomes.Just give it a fair try, and I promise you shouldn't be disappointed.

So I figured, let me get this little novelty item for my kindle. It's kind of freaky to use late at night.  Although I won't go so far as to say it's real.

The word bank must be huge. I have kept it for fun and have even put it on my android. I have had both on together but not picked up the same thing in the same place or gotten the same word on both in fact I have not heard the same word twice on one device or any of the three together (wife's android). So i feel that a random generator/selector is not part of the program since most of those things &#34;pick&#34;  the same word from time to time. just try it what can it hurt?!?

That having been said, go download one of the other versions of this app. It's a lot of fun to prove or disprove your results. Just let the ghosts explain themselves; don't read into what's happening. Enjoy!

Do you realize how annoying you are? Now knock it off.By the way, this app simply lists words at random from the internal dictionary. If you think that it's somehow significant that 1 out of every 100 applies to your current situation than you're even stupider than I thought.

But this app most likely has predetermined dots and words that just pop up at any time. I mean don't get me wrong this is a neat little app, but just think about it... your device has sensors that pick up &quot;ghost&quot; signals? No! Sorry but that's not it. Maybe its just me not fully believing but that's my way of thinking. Other than all that believe what you want!!

I recommend this app to all ghost lovers and mystery lovers! scares you a little but is F-U-N-N-Y! I got a couple of words like; ' below' and 'someone'.

I got &quot;circus&quot; &quot; topic&quot; &quot;news&quot; &quot;selection&quot; and &quot;joined&quot;. the last one only made sense because I walked past a locked gate at my neighbor's house. his dog Maggie died a few years ago but no mention of &quot;dog&quot; or &quot;Maggie&quot;.

But I like to think that it may be a spirit attached to an antique that we may have. I honestly think that that would be really awesome but I'm not getting much clues because the only words I got where pink, shelf, automobile, soldier was a good one and my first one i also got fourth, fellow, and some other bland words.

I just downloaded it and when I opened my app, it was like &quot;pot &quot; and on the right side of me there was a flower pot. I thought it was cool, but come on, there are pots everywhere! either in your yard or somewhere else, you can always find something common with the random word that appears on the radar. Its a cool app, but in my opinion, they just choose a buncha random words that make you think this app can &quot;detect &quot; stuff when your fooling yourself out. I was using it this morning on my bed and it was like &quot;can, winter, principal &quot;?! Wtf, am I in school or something? lol but this app is worth the download even though it might be fake.

I just had this app on and went into my kitchen when it went haywire with words and letters and warnings. It had red, green, yellow, and strange blue dots all over the screen. It was awesome. I really recommend this app. It is lots of fun and I am glad I got it :)Note: Review is from my daughter.  Thus far it seems to do really well, saying "Father" when I am in the room, and saying, "metal" when her Mom is in the room.  Her Mom had a metal rod in her leg when she was younger and it still messes up antennae TV signals when she is near them.  Thus this is a more interesting version then older ones I have been exposed to &lt;--This last part is me.

All it was, really, was a green radar that showed little dots every so often. I quickly got bored with it and deleted it. Afterwards, I was persuaded to actually BUYING the other version of Ghost Radar, which was supposedly &quot;better.&quot; Sure, it was a little cooler. You could go back and forth from the classic radar and an activity waves line graph. It also &quot;translated the ghosts messages to you,&quot; which I actually believed for a while. But don't believe a word of it, people. The radar does not &quot;sense&quot; anything. If you want an app that you can just use for fun, go ahead. But it does NOT sense ghosts. Just saying whaylt your gut is screaming.

I had this on my kindle before but never really used it. After having my Dad pass in March, I showed it to my Mom, and she said we should look in to it. So, I tried to download it from my cloud. It just said queued. But wouldn't load. After a few hours of this, my Mom gave up and went to bed. I went back into the app store and downloaded it again, and sure enough it worked!  So I turned it on and after just a few seconds it started showing dots and saying words! At the same time, the satellite on the tv went out, and Mom's 2 New puppies started to whine! The words were: March, song, highway, adventure, and Rocky. My Dad passed away in March, (last month) My Son played guitar and sang a beautiful song at his funeral. I spent a lot of time with my Dad having adventures on the highway, as we did a lot of traveling. And his passing was very Rocky to say the least. As soon as the dots were gone the puppies settled right down! I just wish I had someone with me at the time to be a witness. In Wisconsin 45yrs old.

I asked what their names were. my kindle said &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, &quot;John&quot;, and &quot;David&quot;.

There is no way that it could have known this info or gotten it from ANY source on my kindle in anyway what so ever. So I have to believe there might be something to this..as much as I don't want to. Becareful because it could seriously freak someone out. Especially someone who believes in ghosts.

Because I was walking by his house (his name is Paul) and a red dot came in his house and the word Paul came up. I got chicken skin and I ignored it. Paul's son is named David, and I said I would laugh if the word David came up. As soon as I said laugh, the word laugh came up. Now I really cot creeped out. Later, I found out the house was built in the early 1900s and in an epidemic of small pox that affected most of Honolulu's Chinatown, some people died...

It has entertained me, my kids, my friends, my wife, my co-workers and so on.  I am a believer in ghosts, but a severe skeptic of this app.  Every now and then it'll creep you out by spouting relevant words and dots in relevant locations, but at least 75% of it appears to be random or void of energy spikes.  Anyone who takes this app too seriously is gullible and anyone who dismisses it completely is joyless.  It delivers fun and entertainment to believers and skeptics alike and should be used solely for entertainment.

Later I was watching the news when I saw a news report about a log fire at a camping sight. It had started 5 minutes before I started getting activity. Supposedly, some teenagers at a site  were  messing  around and then went to bed. None of the realized a fire had started and one of the teens was rushed to the hospital. So yea. Awesome app

Sometimes ghosts seek revenge, or they are friendly. This app is real. Here are what the signals : red, it is very strong. Yellow, strong. Green, weaker. Blue, barely there. This is real. Here's what it did to me one time: I was on my kindle fire on the couch, and it said &quot;wind&quot;. I thought it meant something, so I went to the weather channel. Believe it or not, but there was a big tornado watch in the south, thank goodness I don't live down there. I'm never trying in my bedroom, though. I'm afraid. I admit it. But this app is real. Trust me.

When I first got into my house my mom was taking me on a tour. When we went upstairs and I felt a cold breeze (where my room is originally at.) When we were going back downstairs I felt like someone was watching me. 4 years later I got a kindle fire and I bought this app.I felt someone had fallen down our stairs, so I went on a couple of stairs, I saw nothing. I moved up a little more, and I saw 5 dots. Three were green one was yellow. All the other dots faded and one was left, and it was red and I all a sudden felt a cold breeze about up to my knees. When I first got the app I heard my name. Then I asked where do I live and it said America. I think it is my great grandfather because he had passed away not very long ago.So this really touches me that I know he is still with me.I really think you should buy this it really works

Me and my cousin were just messing around looking for ghost apps and we found this, and downloaded it. We were just watching the words out whatever and it kept saying 'ffee' and we were confused. At the top it said 'Get'and that kinda scared me. I tried joking around and trying to communicating to the 'ghost'. At the top, it said 'Observe'. My cousin said, &amp;#34;What is your name?&amp;#34; And it said 'Joe' and then a huge yellow dot appeared in front of us, and the top said 'Shimmering' It scared me really badly, and I deleted the app instantly. Not because I don't like it, because I was FREAKED OUT. You choose whether to believe it or not..

As soon as I turned it on it said > Maria &lt; and last night I had a dream with an old acquaintance & that's her name. It then said Jack, Army, Knife, Rifle. I do have a knife next to my bed gift from my son a Marine. I came downstairs, where I have all my pets, a small dog, a very playful kitten, and 3 birds. It repeated like four times > animal &lt; and when the kitty started running around and playing it kept repeating > energy &lt; My dog was biting her nails on her left paw, and that's what it said > bite &lt;> left &lt;. Then it said > Barbara &lt; and that's the name of the street I live in. I've had paranormal experiences since a young age, so this doesn't scare me its quite fun. If you know how to use it and what to ask, believe me its worth to download.

It doesn't have a camera, and all devices you can download on do. It utilizes the camera without you knowing, and it identifies the object and says the word. This explains why it needs so much information- it wires to the camera. I didn't realize this until I read you couldn't get it on the fire and it uses a lot of info. If you don't beleive me, you don't, but an app can't utilize 1,000-5,000 dollar equipment.

Did you expect ghosts to pop up and have interesting conversations with you and follow you around 24/7 ? Have some fun with it, try to figure out why it does what it does, mess with minds of believers if you wish. But learn to have fun, not be critical when uncalled for,  and don't complain about a program you didn't have to install anyway. Most enjoy showing how easy it is to replicate the goofy stuff on TV. That is fun. Some people like to have fun and be mock serious, just as some of you like to carry on to get a reaction. Stop flaming and REALLY PAY ATTENTION to what they say. IF the program is excessive in battery usage, that's a claim to consider. Most of the other stuff is petty. Others having problems with this program draining battery?

And I think I got those colors and dot shapes down. Red=demon/evil Yellow=unknown ghost Green= friendly ghost/friend or family Blue=angel. I have heard about the colors being how strong their signal is, but how do you explain the fading? I believe THAT is how you tell how strong their signal is. Oh and if you look carefully, you can see that some are round and some are square. Round=girl/female Square=boy/male. And then you see these random letters at the the bottom left. I think these are the sounds it is picking up. It does talk, and when it does it usually says very random words like, Sam, of, Sell, Enter. You probably won't understand them most of the time, and that's ok. Oh and if you notice that the color may change from green to red or yellow to green, etc. That's natural. But you may want to slay those red ones. :P I use a fake sword. It is fun. :) Overall, it is a great app. It is up to you if it is real or not. It is only real if you let it seem real. I go halfway because it has some fake qualities. But have fun with it! I know I am! P.S. I think I have a ghost that likes me. :P

I ran across this app today and had to try it.  I recently got a new wedding ring that I have been walking around my house gazing at.  a red dot appeared today and the word Mrs. was spoken!  the question of my ex appeared (his name)  followed by Available.  key words that only I would understand kept appearing.  my oldest son was a baby when my mother died. I allowed him to try and speak with her,  a red dot appeared and the word Giant and My was said.  too many on point coincidences for me.  I say it is worth the download if you are curious.  But be careful!  you never know what or who you are inviting in your home.

So i kinda thought it somehow used the phone's camera, I was at the store and it said shelf and then I got shivers and it said breeze. But the big selling point was when I was in my room changing and the app said change...the phone was on my bed with the camera facing the sheets so it wasn't the camera.I don't know if its 100% accurate or real but its probably 75% entertaining and 25% real. Kinda like a ouija board thats sold as a game but then theres creepy stories about it.But its fun when it talks, usually a lot of silence.

At first there was nothing happening but then it started lighting up all over the place. I was watching &quot;Moby Dick&quot; with the volume up high. It said, &quot; look&quot;, &quot; letter&quot;, &quot;auithor&quot;, &quot;funny&quot; and &quot;William&quot;. I turned the volume off and asked,&quot; William who?&quot; No response so far although a hurricane warning from msnbc did pop up while I was typing this and scared the crap outta me. This is so cool. Hehehe!

I was in a cross between: a Gryffindor  sweat shirt with worn skinny jeans and Ugg boots or a Camp Half Blood t shirt with skinny jeans and high tops. So I asked the Ghost Radar,&quot; Oh wise and powerful ghost in my room, which shall I WEAR?!&quot; I waited.and waited.and waited. then I freaked out. it said:&quot; Wear, sweat, shirt&quot;I literally cried out in excitement!!!!! This ghost had taste like a huge nerd like me!!!!!Theresa(:

It is fine for free, but nothing that you can do by looking at the calendar.  Sometimes you get information on some things then others it wont help at all.

Maybe they thought people would get their moneys worth that way to give people who paid for it more fake excitement? It seems that way to me.If you're into the paranormal, I would download the free version just if you're curious but don't buy the paid version. The free version is better, in my opinion.Don't expect this to be a serious tool--it's just a toy.

I ran to my local church, and had the priest do an exorcism on my phone, and sure enough, after the excorcism, my phone battery now lasts twice as long.  on a side note...I knew that yappy dog next door was posessed, and after shooting it with holy water, it burst into flames.

It's also a way to prank your friends into believing your crazy made up ramblings and making them parinoid. I know cause I've done it. It's hillarious. Anyways, while I do beloved in ghost ,there's no reason to take this so seriously. I mean the company or whatever that made this is named spud pickles so you shouldn't really believe it. That's like trusting someone named seedy. It is a fun game. It's funny to watch parinoid people freak out over it (I always explain to them that its fake after I stop laughing) . I like it .

I searched out many spirits, most of whom became fast friends (well, some of them were a bit decayed and they weren't so fast).My issues began after my recent demise in a construction accident. I wound up in a number of pieces. It can be quite challenging to keep track of all of them. This application does an adequate job of finding the big pieces like my legs but isn't sensitive enough for my fingers and nose. Since the little pieces are the ones that usually get lost, this is a serious drawback.

Good layout and great for young children. It's up to you to believe if this is real or not. I use it mainly for creativity purposes.

Like when i thought it was weird, it gave back WEIRD. when i thought ha ha that's kinda creepy it gave back CREEPY. I thought about ice cream just to mess with the train of thoughts, and it gave back DAIRY,  followed by COLD afterwards.Then it hit me. I am a ghost.It took some remembering, but i died years back in a car accident, and i had been in denial this whole time.Thanks to this app, i was able to realize that i had passed on, and finally cross over. well. not yet. i am writing this before i finally rest. :)

I was standing in the kitchen and thought to myself what was I just gonna do? it was it that moment that the word &quot;pot&quot; appeared on the screen. oh yeah that's right I was gonna go have some pot. so off to the garage me and probly most of the ghost in the house went to get our bake on. truly this is an amazing application full of surprises and dare I say a mind reader.

All day I get messages of "words spoken".  It never shuts off and keeps going.  When words are spoken it never makes sense at all.  I'll get "fire" "Norway" "also", it just throws random words out.  But I do like it the kids have a lot of fun with it so I let them go on their own ghost adventure.  So for fun factor I gave it 3 stars.  Obviously it's not real and I never expected it to be but when I shut down an app in my phone I would like it to stop.

(Which I assume were ghosts)?Then my phone starts popping off word after word. Are these ghosts having a conversation? It seemed like all nonsensical words. Well after a couple of minutes of this I said aloud, "Go away ghosts, I'm trying to work here!"Suddenly the radar went blank and for the next 20 minutes not another word came out of my phone. I finished my work and turned the app off.Freaky Man!

Which was weird bc I was sitting. so I started to say some names. names I said Grandma Brown, Grandpa Brown, Ben, Grandpa Wallace. then it popped up a word saying Fewer. then a few words came up I didn't understand like Fox, Entry and Simply. then I asked who this was and it popped up Dan Just now. It really creeped me out bc my dads name is Dan (he has not passed yet). Going to wait it out before I make my review a 5 star. I really recommend getting this app if you are into parnormal stuff.

But the reason its 4 stars is because there are different colors of ghosts and there is no key to defining what they stand for. Other than that, good job!

I have a couple tales to tell:When I felt like something was wrong, I went outside and the ghost radar said &quot;safe&quot; which made me happy for some odd reason.The next time I used it, the radar said &quot;press&quot;, and you know when you press the screen it automatically goes to the tracking thing, so I did and it showed a green orb sitting by me. So... that was.... weird.Last of all, It showed to red orbs where my smoking neighbors were. I knew they were evil...That's pretty much it so far. I recommend this for a lot of people, it's fun.

I started wearing clothes aroused the house because the ghosts were making me feel selfconcious.The first word that came out for me was not fart, but it was the second.  Some eerily accurate words.  It said the word power right before I unplugged it from the wall.Fun app, solid, entertaining, HTC EVOthe nudist

I have always wondered why she could walk through walls or why she didn't have a reflection until now. It is a little strange being able to tell people that you are married to a ghost but once they meet her they see that she is an almost normal person. I haven't had the guts to tell my wife yet though, not sure how she is going to react. At least she isn't a zombie!

This came in practical use I was able to find the ghost of my dead uncle and he directed me to where he buried his money- it would have been lost forever- or worse found by staff of the camp for disadvantaged children on who's land it was hidden.I also use this app to make sure the bathroom is clear before I take a shower or "do my business." I really don't want ghosts of dead relatives watching me in there. It's kind on creepy when you think about it- now, no more worries!I might buy a 2nd phone just to keep this app on all the time.

For instance: it said my dad's name. I haven't had contact with him in about 5 years. That night I see that he found me on Facebook and sent me a (20 days late) birthday message. I can't decide if I believe in the astronomical odds against that coincidence, or if there was something supernatural about it.If you don't believe in the ghost thing at all, I still say download it. You will probably have fun with it.

See he killed himself last July and I miss him so badly. Anyways, I started the game and walked around and got some random words like question and paragraph. I got bored and sat on the couch. Not much happened after that so I figured it needed movement so I started shaking it. Soon words came popping out but I froze when the word brother came up. The next word was beside. I kid you not! I couldn't help tearing up even though it was probably just random words that happened to sync up. Nothing interesting after that but it shook me a little.

Of course, it's all bogus anyway -- how would a tablet sense ectoplasmic emanations, even if they were real? I was hoping it would be at least interesting and fun, like the "alien scanner" I used to have on my palm pilot years ago, but it's just technobabble.

I turned it on this morning and one of the first things it said was, &quot;court&quot; holy cow!! My husband is in court this morning !! How would a simple app know my husband was in court??? I didn't download this until late last night, long after we were discusing his case. It also mentioned several other things that noone knew about let alone what seemed to be a cheesy app - believe me its not. It works. I even got 3 different names of spirits that may be here. Yes, we have A LOT of paranormal activity here.Yes I do believe in ghosts, I did before the app but this app is making me even more of a believer!!!What's even freakier is that I had gotten this app from getjar for free, the exact same app as this free app of the day and its free on Amazon today. I downloaded it late last night.

I have a ghost right in front of me, but all the detector picked up on was the pixies in my sock drawer and the monster snoozing under my son's bed.I'd recommend installation of the application only to detect supernatural, not paranormal, activity. It doesn't even sense my inner demons or the ghost in the machine!

Many of these ghosts were outright determined to harass and element the entire family.  The family pets would sometimes mysteriously disappear in the middle of the night.  The family would sometimes find the front door mysteriously  ajar.  And sometimes they would hear mysterious thumping sounds from somewhere down the hallway, around where their teenager's.bedroom is.This app made it possible to finally detect these poltergeists!  After carefully using this app, focusing all my attention on the device for only 3 hours, I was able to see, for just a moment, what would otherwise look like a piece of dust floating.  Of course, since I was using the Ghost Radar app, I was confident that this could be no piece of dust - I had spotted, if only for a split second, the guilty poltergeist!I'm only giving this game 4 stars out of 5 because it doesn't tell you the next step.  In other words, how do I now get rid of the poltergeists?C'mon, developers, get with the program!

No. it's not. so I believe this app is not yo be taken serious but as just getbsome laughs out and dont be afraid to let the child inside of you out and just have some good ole fun.Deuces everybody DJ Collyder out and happy Halloween

I have to say it is pretty freaking creepy at times. I was showing it to my son when it said &quot;railroad&quot;. he was playing a game and his computer guy was on a railroad. we had said nothing about a railroad.Other weird ones are when I was talking about my mom and it started with words like Texas, health, camp... things that relate to her. I said nothing about those things.Or it said &quot;government traffic&quot; my phone went nuts, the app force closed, wouldnt open, glitched and then i had to download it again. Started it up and the first thing it said was &quot;see&quot;. trippy!My son said his stomach hurt and it said &quot;corn&quot;. sure enough he had eaten something with corn and was feeling the effects. the phone wasnt even with me when he ate.Its just weird, fascinating and creepy. just said &quot;Saturday, worker&quot;. I work on Saturday.So if its a gimmick, its a darned convincing gimmick. But the next time I lose my my keys again, i am turning it on b/c when i was searching for mine it said &quot;table&quot;. they were there. I dont usually keep my keys on the table. i lose them if i do.I'm a little freaked out now.

I thought I would give this a try....I figured this was probably just a fun thing to play with. When I operated it and it analyzed the room I was in and later listed the events in that room. I was shocked. Both my mother and father had died about 15-20 years ago. My dad had always promised to come back and let me know if he was ok after he passed...well he did within a week one night when I went to bed and couldn't sleep. I saw this man smiling at me and it scared me so I jumped out of bed and he disappeared. The next day as I set at my desk I looked up to see the photo he had given me of his time in the Navy in Australia and here was the handsome wavy black haired man that had smiled at me. He had always said that was the happiest time of his life. Well when the Ghost Radar Legacy listed the events that happened it mentioned the word mill....my dad had worked for years in the saw mill....I knew then that he was still watching over me. This was no coincidence....out of millions of words that could have popped up....also it mentioned struggle and he had a horrible time his last few hours....So this is very worth trying out. I cannot guarantee you will have a connection like I did but many have and if you do it will be amazing.

At any rate, this is a very fun app to scare the kids with on Halloween. What better than to tell ghost stories and then check the house to see if there are "ghosts" around. You always get a result with the app, but it can be incredibly variable which adds to the eerie value.

I opened the the app and almost right away a red dot showed up and it said my grandfathers name..not his real name but the name the grand kids called him. There is NO WAY that the app could have known that as there is nothing in my kindle.. apps,documents pictures, profiles or anything that would know that, and no one in the room was talking about anything or anyone at the time so a mic couldn't have picked up on anything we might have said. So real or not, in my opinion there has to be something to this. I just download the paid version (for .99 cents)that is said to be more advanced and I will be spending the overnight monitoring whatever goes on. I searched the net and alot of sites said 3am is the "dead" hour so we'll see what kind of activity happens. If your curious try the free version first and check it out..you may be surprised at what happens. If something doesn't happen right away, don't give up..give it a chance. I've had it running for the last 6 hours and dots pop-up and words appear. Just not constantly. Most have no meaning to me, but that doesn't mean its not real. I know some of the people say its fake and alot say its real..all I know is what happened with me this morning was real enough for me to investigate further. It may be a bunch of BS but its going to be fun finding out. If you do download and try it go to the apps website and its explains how to works.

I was creeped out, but whatever.

I visited the Spud Pickles website, which I really liked &amp; recommend. Then I read the reviews in the app store. After reading the hilarious ones, the ones that praised it, &amp; the &quot;nay-sayers&quot; &amp; &quot;humbuggers&quot;, it was definitely the &quot;nay-sayers&quot; &amp; &quot;humbuggers&quot; that did it for me. I supposed if they were taking it so seriously, it must be &quot;serious&quot;! So thank you &quot;nay-sayers&quot; &amp; &quot;humbuggers&quot;, because of you I downloaded this app &amp; it has become one of my favorites! I did read a review that reported the app drained their battery, I have a Kindle Fire &amp; have not experienced any problems at all, the app works great. I can leave it run while I do other things on my Kindle, &amp; even while its asleep. Even while I'm asleep-which I have to say has had some creepy results! I don't about you, but I don't like to hang any limbs off my bed for fear of &quot;something&quot; getting me, &amp; this app confirmed those fears!! Call me childish, but I won't be taking any chances-hands &amp; feet securely tucked in blankets!! Overall fun app, performs well, &amp; like I said-creepy!

I happened to look outside &amp; noticed a tree down in my backyard. I forgot about the app, leaving it on as I went outside &amp; for the next 3 hours, took a chain saw to the tree, trying to clean up the mess. When I got done &amp; back inside, I picked up the kindle, noticing the words recorded the whole time I was outside. Not only was my first name there, Ellen, but the words, danger, branches, noise, storm, tree, wind, emergency. There was no one in the house the whole time I was outside, nor had I called anyone and no one called me

Just seemed to get some things right with the words it spoke.1st incident:  Was in the bathroom stinking up the place (#2) and then the app said, &quot;sell, memory, row&quot;.  I laughed at it and kept going.  When flushing, the toilet clogged up and I had a minor flood in the bathroom.  Its nothing large enough to &quot;row&quot; in, but I thought I would &quot;sell&quot; yall my &quot;memory&quot;....hahahaha.2nd incident:  Was in my room when it said &quot;useful, cutting&quot;.  So, I decided to investigate the house to see whats up.  Weird thing I found, my mother was clipping coupons.  Spooky right?5 stars for giving me something else to do and for being a spooky word generator.  As far as the radar, could be better.

Well, you probably should not have downloaded the app in the first place. It's Halloween! It's silly! Don't take life so seriously.

It's going to be serious. I am a skeptic at heart as should all people be. If you already have your mind made up then you're wasting your time. What freaked me out were the words the thing said. I always dismiss things when possible or discount them as coincidence,but enough coincidence equals an affirmation. Not there yet,but this is still interesting. The first word it said was &quot;lying &quot; which is exactly what was on my mind about a friend. Then it said a name of a friend of mine. It said the name of another friend,his Dads name,and then his cats name. Then it said &quot;sing &quot; which is an inside joke between us. Of course it's more than likely coincidence,but it still gave me a slight freakout. Now if I talk to my freinds tomorrow and they happened to be thinking about me when the words were spoken.... that's what would freak me the frak out. Interesting app allegedly fake or not. What harm does an open mind have?

A lot of the times the words don't make any sense, and I did run the app on two phones next to each other at the same time.  Results were DIFFERENT.  That makes me disbelieve.  It also detected activity while I was driving down the road.  Can't believe based on this app, but it is FUN.

But will people please stop discouraging believers with comments like &quot;you all are idiots if you believe In ghosts!

You turn on the app and it scans your surrounding area listening and scanning with radar for the presence of ghostly spirits. It randomly says a word in an electronic voice and saves it in a list. The radar spins and it shows you the presence of spirits nearby.Main screen:* VOX* Radar a series of red, blue and green dots appear and disappear from the screen supposedly indicating the presence of ghosts* Words - captures a list of random words that supposedly were spoken by a ghost.* Stop radar - stops radar from spinning* Settings - adjust sensitivity of the device from low, med, high and advanced.* Advanced - allows you the ability to adjust the sensitivity of your device's sensors. This includes Scan frequency, duplicate detection threshold, display impedance, signal timeout and signal capacitance.What I like:It was free!What I don't like:The waste of time to download this app and looking at the screen. Unless these ghosts are speaking via WIFI my Kindle Fire won't hear them as the Kindle Fire does not have a microphone. Just about the only way the Kindle Fire would convince me that it detected a ghost is if it flew out of my hands and hit me in the head.Summary:This app is a complete time waster and a waste of battery power. If it is an electronic Ouija Board it is slow, boring and useless. In an hour it heard 9 words that absolutely make no sense. They were: motor, this, sugar, safety, whether, frozen, creature, muscle and soap. Unless the spirit drove their car into a frozen lake because of eating too much sugar and was attacked by a creature with a muscle cramp and covered with soap then I don't know what this means?This app is just silliness and not worth the time to download. If you like such things you might enjoy it but I won't waste the batteries on my tablet for this app. The only thing recently appearing and disappearing in my house is this app.Size: this app is 3.29MB on my Kindle Fire.Permissions:System tools - modify global system settings

I got bored so I said outloud what word am I spelling; p-e-t-e-r. it said a bunch of random words for a while so I turned off my kindle. about five minutes larger I checked it again and the list of words it had said was seven. one of then was Peter!!!!!!!!!! I'm freaking out!!!

Anyways I'm going to stick with the free ghost radar classic only because I don't like paying my money for an app that has a free version. Lets get down to the facts. The radar I have Wichita many of you have had or heard of works like this one. This one has more features is all. I do believe in spirits. I believe they do not want to hurt us. I believe they like to try to get help known as lost souls. I use the free version of this whenever I get the chance. There are over 10 different responds I got that makes me believe its real. I don't remember all ten but I remember my first one. I was in my reclining chair and opens the app, I put Mt blanket on and was relaxed, it then said comfortable. I was like ok, wasn't too impressed. then I went to lay back and it said relaxed. I thought ok 2 fluiks. I went to close my eyes and it said rest. I almost threw my kindle on the ground amazed at what I heard and saw. I told my family that lives with me and they said it might be real. So I went to breathe and the room wasn't cold, but I saw my own breath, then it said hello. I then believed from that moment on that there is really an after life, I knew since I was little that God is real! through the reading I found that God is yes very real. Spirits can contact us, and this is an app that truely proves it. The free version is the one I'm talking about. Get this if you want it, get the free version, ghost radar is an amazing experience, I hope you find what I did if not more.

It claims to detect and track paranormal activity that happens to be nearby, and to be able to measure local electromagnetic energies, vibrations and sounds.Who am I to argue with this?This app takes up just 2.8MB on your Kindle Fire or other Android devices, and once you've downloaded it, you'll be able to customize its interface to meet your own personal paranormal inquisitiveness. You can adjust its sensitivity to adjust for background noise, and toggle between its numerical & graphical interface. And if you're taking your Kindle Fire into a serious business meeting, you can stop it before your boss thinks that you're a bit loopy.But if you take it into a Starbucks or similar coffee shops during that caffeine break, just watch what happens.For those interested in supposed paranormal activity, there are other apps available out there to add to your ghost-busting arsenal. There'sEMF Sensor, but that won't work on a Kindle Fire because this device lacks a magnetic field sensor which is necessary to display any data. There'sGhost Detectorand even anAny Detector, but read the reviews and specs before you buy any of these.ThisGhost Radar: LEGACYmay fit all of your ghost-busting needs and satisfy your curiosity about paranormal activity that may or may not be present. In any case, it's a lot more fun than some of those games likeAngry WeaselsorScary Gerbilsthat seventeen or more other people in your near vicinity may be playing.But if the word "Observe" pops up, you better pay attention...10/25/2012

The reason I didn't give it a better score was not because of what it is or what is was supposed to be or do. It was just for fun.  It was because of the way it worked. It used way to much system resources and was nearly impossible to turn off. On more than one occasion I had thought I had turned it off only to find it still running in the background. I couldn't find any setting to shut it off on exit. I had to use the app killer installed in order to close it. Quite annoying.

I'm usually not one to turn the daily free app away, especially when it could be a handy tool, so I downloaded it.  Needless to say, I was impressed.  Don't be fooled by the developers claims that this is merely for entertainment purposes.  This is a serious tool, and after many test runs around my house I found it to be 100% accurate.  It is not to be taken lightly.This software inspired me to quit my job and pursue my lifelong dream of being a professional ghost hunter.  I may not have any experience or know much about the field, but &quot;Ghost Radar&quot; is all I need for ghost bustin'.  I've already set up my website and everything.  I've even got my first client.  A pastor from an old haunted church.  I intend to show that congregation more than just the holy ghost!  They'll be so impressed by this technology and my ability to operate it.Thanks Amazon and Ghost Radar for making dreams come true!

Well after using it myself several times. The words it revealed did not make much sense to me. Last night while I was sitting reading a book, It said the words sit, book, and  drink. On the side of my chair I had a glass of tea. It gave me the creeps, I felt like I was being watched! I recommend this app to everyone or anyone that has ever doubted that their is such a thing as spiritual presence living among us.

I was goofing around with it with my teen son, and I pretended I was mad at him and yelled, and the words came back with, "She" and then a second later "Mad".Everyone in the room laughed and thought it was funny. When we use it here in the house, we get a few green and yellow and red blips from time to time, but nothing major. So we decided to take it to Galveston, Texas, the third most haunted city in the United States (according to some sources), and we ended up not getting a single blip at all in the Strand District, where hundreds of people were supposed to have died in the hurricane years and years ago. But when we used it in the Walmart parking lot, we got several blips and some words that were people's names: Tim, David, Bill.So, okay, if you're willing to make fun of things and not take this seriously, it's great entertainment, and my teen son loves it. Otherwise, it's just a silly little game that is great for sparking conversation or playing with at parties or get-togethers.

I am part of a paranormal research team and this is soooo much better than a ghost box. If you use it where there's nothing there, you get random words, but if you use it in the right place it's great ! Just give it about a 1/2 hour to adjust to the envirorment before you take it seriously. I also like the radar so you can see any energy that is around. We assume these are equal to the orbs we get on video. It also keeps a history of "words spoken" so you don't even have to be with it. You can review them later. It will run 3 to 4 hrs. which is plenty of time for an investigation. LOVE IT !!!

Then it said water and suddenly the water heater in the garage made a large ping!  Then the app did something really freaky.  It said &quot;danger over&quot; no joke!

The comments made by numerous reviewers here on Amazon tells me that there is some truth behind GHOSTS! after-all.Also, no matter what people might say here for our entertainment the matter of fact that they downloaded the app and tried itself is a testament that in their back of their head they believe in Ghosts that includes me!'GHOST' Radar does make one think about a 'remote' possibility of finding one. The app just does that beautifully and deserves the applause and rating. The APP worked just fine on my Galaxy tab 10.1 and as that device has more sensors compared to my original Kindle fire which has almost zero sensors I have limited capablity to finding one - Does tilt sensor count? for ghost detection? :DThe APP definitely has some fun in the package and while we all know that there is nothing like ghosts which can be detected by an Android app the fact that the developer did a good job on developing this app deserves a 4 star rating for the sheer fun you can have with the app.Happy Halloween!

I haven't figured out the advanced options yet but the "Info" and "FAQ" are better than most. It's straightforward and tells you that it "does NOT detect EMF nor gravity".Just in time for Halloween... I think the kids will enjoy this the most. Can't wait to see them walking around the house, trying to find ghosts in the dark. :)

Some of this is, you'll pardon the pun, dead on but hell, creepiest thing is the digital voice. What do the different colored dots mean? One showed up blue with a red circle around it.

Inevitably there's other people who will take their money and lie to them. Want to believe your dead beloved exists? Someone will gladly tell you she's &quot;out there&quot;, for a price. Want to believe you can speak with her? Someone will gladly tell you they can speak with the dead, for a price. So when someone tells you your phone can detect ghosts, don't be fooled.

I have done a lot of research on this app because at one point it did keep saying &#34;Billy&#34; and I know no Billy, but about 3 days later a Billy comes by that my husband hasn't seen in a very long time.

Found nothing in shed, backyard (where I buried my pet mouse george). Then when my homie Wilbur came over he messed around with the settings.

Wibur and I said screw it, and I'm leasing the house anyways so we jack hammered the foundation. After hours of digging we found real gold coins..... We're poring the concrete back now......

Recommend it for any paranormal lover or for people who are into this sort of thing. Of course when I tell friends, family, and strangers about it they laugh, roll their eyes, and try to tell me it's just hooplah but they shan't take away my joy that the ghost radar provides me. Don't expect a million ghosts all at once giving you tons of words. Just give it some time and they'll show up give words at 'their' own pace. This is the first app I ever downloaded when I got a smartphone, so it will always be special to me ;)

The app did detect a ghost inside. It said: Johnatan, sick, rest, care, lake, (At that time I stood up and moved away) Next words were move, come, hide and so on.

I have freaked out my 18-year-old daughter, and friends. Sometimes it spouts off words that make you go "hummm." For instance I had it running (on my KFire) one morning as I was getting ready for work. I walked out into the hallway where one of my cats was sitting and suddenly the radar said "feed". Yes indeed the cat was waiting for me to feed him.Most of the time it says things that don't make much sense but I get a kick out of it just the same. Yes, I am easily amused. :)

It was unable to detect a known ghost living in my home for several decades.Back in the early 60s, a middle aged man was murdered in my home by a home intruder. This man's spirit has yet to leave the physical world for the spiritual as his murder has never been solved. He REFUSES to leave. This has been validated by several ghost hunting experts and I often hear him moaning about being hungry or tired.I tried using this app to detect his location but it wouldn't work. In fact, I knew he was in the bathroom at one point playing with the cat, but the app told me there was a "reading" in the kitchen.So, to sum it up, for those looking for something cheap to help them detect the ghosts living around us, look elsewhere.This app makes a mockery of the dead and the developers should be ashamed.

If it detects the number of gremlins at my door hollering "Trick or Treat" then I'd be a firm believer of the paranormal. Be nice if it can create a video of the activity, that would at least provide a record of what happened. I encourage the devs to keep up the good work and investigate another app that will sense UFOs so I can start taking pictures and videos. Thanks Amazon!

The first word was 'snake' which oddly enough there was a snake in my office a few months ago.4 stars since its a one-size-fits-all screen. Doesn't fill the screen in portrait mode on my Moto Atrix.  Landscape looks fine, and I like the 'stop radar on exit' feature.It's a fun app to rib people who believe in the paranormal.

If I knew earlier that all it took was a random word generator and a fake radar graphic to make people freak out as if I was some sort of medium with an Android phone... I would have written this app myself.  This is genius and really fun to play with! But anybody that thinks it's real and can actually talk to spirits? I would seriously question their sanity.

FYI, I'm the kind of person who sings in the shower. So, I'm singing Rock God by Selena Gomez and I get out. I was sceptical of ghosts and I thought this was a joke. so I mutter to myself,&quot; Yeah, I'll get some words from the other side,&quot;  I go to the Words column and I literally gasp with shock. it says,Please, Sing, louder. I'M LITERALLY GOING TO DIE. THIS THING IS STALKING ME. then, yesterday, this ghost named Chuck was calling me names. He called me Fatty, Loser, and the B word. I'm sad.-T.S.

I am glad I didn't pay any real money for this as this is like a "Rick Roll" type app which doesn't really do anything productive.  It was obviously meant to promote Sean Austin's music career.This app would be useful to people who want ideas to start their own music careers by picking a strange catchy name for your developer name and disguising it as something else such as a party gag type app.I agree with the many other reviewers that the reviews for this app are rather funny and entertaining.  Therefore, I am giving it 2 stars just because it gets people wanting to discuss their app purchases on Amazon.

My daughter made fun, at first, but her younger brother loved it.  It struck his imagination, and he started ghost-hunting immediately.  After dark, even the teenager got in on the fun.The only problem I've found is that it KILLS YOUR BATTERY FAST.  The app says it basically uses all if your sensors, microphone, etc., so I'm sure that is why, but keep it in mind.I'm not saying it's a great ghost-hunting tool, but it's a cute little app that has given my kids hours of fun.

I was picking up a few words that seemed meaningless. Then, jokingly, I said, &quot;what's your name?&quot; About five seconds later the word &quot;William&quot; came up. In another instance my little brother threw a can in the garbage can and the word &quot;score&quot; popped up. It creeped me out just a little. Love the app though and it's really neat

What's different is the letters change after a certain amount of time so while you're thinking of words with a set of letters, you have to switch gears fast for a different set.  Very entertaining for both kids and adults.

The game seems to be enjoyable, but nothing would happen when I tried to select a letter. I tapped; I tried sliding the letter; I just pushed on the letter. It worked about 10% of the time.I tried the app twice. However, it was much more trouble than it was worth and I deleted it from my Kindle Fire...twice.

Then it moves on to another string of letters.  I find some sets easy, and others challenging, but I have always been able to think of at least one word for any set.  Even with the easy sets, I have to think fast to get a three-letter word, four-letter word, and so on, before it changes sets.It's great for when I'm not sure how much time I'll have to play because I can quit a game any time.  This is a must-have app for Wordies.  No problems loading on mySamsung Galaxy Tab, it doesn't hang up, and there are no intrusive ads.

As a possible improvement, it would be nice to know somehow what the correct 6 letter word was.  You have a limited time (30 sec or so) to guess 3, 4, 5, and 6 letter words.  Then you get new letters.  We enjoy this game a lot!

Very configurable, with different lines and coin requirements, and multiple near complete themes. I say near complete because there is only one set of sounds. The dev may be intending to add more as there is a custom theme option which allows you mix and match machines, symbols, and sounds.The graphics are done pretty old for the machine, symbols done much better. The game runs very stable and smoothly.

Simple in over all design, your job is to keep track of the various wants of the customers, sending them to the appropriate place as quickly as possible.  The fast you cue them up, the higher your score.  Each level adds complexity with new activities, faster influx of customers, and multiple wants.  Thrown in there is the customer whose needs change part way through (gotta potty!)  Control is simple, just point to select the customer and then where they are to go.  As easy as that sounds, I found that often my input was missed, or selected the wrong item/customer due to multiple objects being close to one another.  The game starts off slow but pick up speed pretty quick.  Graphics are ok, nothing fabulous, but the whole thing works well.  The animations of the customers doing the many activities is funny, though watching them too long can cost you some points.  Sound and music match the graphics, tying the whole game together.

Alot of free app's are just that free, you open and u can't use most of the features cause thay want a fee to do so. This one is simple to use and move around in. Streaming live TV, news vid's, news articles, my stocks watch list, and alot more. Sometimes with a weaker connection u can't load vids or watch live TV. but everything else loads well on weak signals. I recommend this app to all.

The fact that it only works in portrait mode, does not support partial shares, and does not display after-hours trading data, have caused me to rate it lower than I otherwise would have.On the other hand, the news and market sections are well thought out, and it seems to be stable (I have yet to experience a crash, though I haven't been using it for very long).It is worth noting -- for those that might not be suspecting it -- that the app is add supported, however, the adds have not been intrusive in my experience, and (since the app was free) this did not affect my rating.Overall, it's a good app, however, it is missing several crucial features.Pros:-- News section easy to browse, and grouped by appropriate categories which can be turned on and off.-- Market data is well laid out, grouped by category, then by geographic area with icons representing the industry, or nationality of the security.-- Includes currencies, bonds, and futures which are commonly left out by other financial apps.-- Does not require excessive permissions on your Android device (only needs network information and the ability to create sockets).Cons:-- No partial shares.-- Only works in portrait mode.-- Font size can not be adjusted.-- No after hours trading data.

This is easily one of the best apps I've found in the Android Market.  Perhaps the most useful feature is the ability to view signal strength of all nearby access points on a nice chart listing all of the available channels, making it very easy to see when two or more access points are interfering with each other, and demonstrating which channels would be available for use to reduce such interference in the future.

I can't tell you how many times I've used it to make sure my wi-fi was working. Or how I've used it to find the source of wi-fi so I make sure I have a strong signal. It's also great at helping you choose which channel to use so that you don't interfere with your neighbor's signal. This is a must have app for any geek.

My favorite view is the third screen, the one with the bar display. This is my default view, once you choose this view the next time you start an app it will come up displaying that view.In this view the length of the bar indicates the strength of the signal. The icon on the left shows you whether the channel is open or secured. My tablet is WiFi only, so when I travel it is very handy to quickly see if there are any open WiFi networks and which one of them is the strongest.Another piece of information that is useful is the channel. This is the setting that is useful at home where you can control which channel you are using. If you see that you are sharing the same channel with several other people you can switch which channel your router is using to broadcast WiFi and get a stronger signal.  To figure out what is the best option  use View #4 (details below).The other views that I use less often are:The first view  is the graph chart that shows you the strength of all WiFi signals.The second view shows you a meter that shows your the strength of your network.The third one (my favorite) is described above in detail.The forth one shows the channel in your area with stars indicating the best reception.  This view is useful if view 3 shows you that you are sharing the channel with many people and you decide to switch.  This screen will help you to choose the best alternative.View 5 shows color coded chart of activity for all local to you WiFi networks. At the top you see a legend for the color-coding. What you want to see that your WiFi line does not cross any other lines, as this would indicate no noise from your neighbor's networks.This app works well on my Samsung Galaxy 7.7 Tablet running Android HoneyComb. I had no technical problems and the app scales to my screen size very nicely.Ali Julia review

I do like the meter function, it helps a lot when you want to walk in the strongest direction. I do not know why it does not show other signals when I can see them on the phone wifi selection. I have gone through the settings several times and nothing seems to get them to show up. But it was only .99 so I guess the meter function is worth that.

Unfortunately, the developer seems to have chosen to keep it ad based rather than offering a paid, ad-free version, and I find ads to be a serious turn-off in any app. I'm so sick of seeing blurry in-app ads for a local car dealer I've sworn never, ever, to do business with them. Ever. Seriously. (Yes, I mean YOU Pohanka Hyundai) In fact, I can't recall ever actually seeing an in-app advertisement that made me want to buy whatever product they were selling, but I can think of dozens of apps I've looked at and then removed because they were ad based. Most such ads are poorly done, difficult to actually read on such a small screen, and block portions of the app you're trying to use, and that's exactly the case with this app. Sorry, that makes this app worth, maximum, 3 stars to me. But offer an ad-free version and I'll gladly rate it 5 stars. Thumbs up if you agree.

Open it up and, if you have the graph selected, you can see all the wireless signals in the area, centered on its channel, and the height of the peak corresponds to signal strength. Walk around the house to see how the signal strength changes. Surprisingly, there were several more signals - about 3X as many than shown on my phone or laptop - picked up by this app.  I installed a wireless extender and was able to optimize its location using Wireless Analyzer. There's a lot more it can do, but this alone has me sold!

I was able to find a channel that was free and switch my router over to that, problem solved.

If it goes up in better signal or down. 3) Channel Rating - Gives it's review stars on best channels for WiFi router. 4) AP List (MY FAVORITE ONE) - This gives a bar graph to each WiFi area and the channel and also the IP Address, Gateway, Server IP and more. It even gives the name of the Router! 5) Signal Meter - BEST ONE I use this often! This is from -100 (No WiFi) to -40 Strongest WiFi. Note that when you are in the GREEN area from -60 to -40 you are at a VERY STRONG (5 bar) WiFi signal.Before I purchased this exceptional tool, I was having trouble with my WiFi signal in one end of my house. As it turned out by looking at the AP List type of graph picture (which shows all local WiFi strength and channels) my next door neighbor and I both has the same brand of router and each of our routers was set to channel one. So, I reset my router to 6 (which is stronger channel) and no more problems with WiFi even at the far end of my home.Another great thing about this WiFi app is the fact that I can test different devices to see which one has the strongest WiFi signal and keeps the strong signal. This is important to me as I want to travel with the device that has the strongest WiFi radio for best reception.Also, I use this tool to see how well my own router is signaling the WiFi and on the go, use it to check other WiFi signals so I can choose the strongest one for my device.So I hope that you will try this one out, I believe that you will love this app!

I give an app of this type time to see what it can do for finding those access points known as hot spots. I can follow the readings ok, but I too wish it had a free adds version available. Maybe that was going to be for this offering of an WiFi analyzer from this company. Test and use over time will tell, if this app is worth keeping on the Kindle Fire HD Tablet. I will give it a try, and I will keep searching for others to have a possible back up of the same type app available for my Kindle Fire HD. I think the multitude of resources like the guide books and manuals help one know what is true or works true to use.

I logged into my wireless router and switched to an unused channel and my Kindle Fire connectivity improved tremendously. My Roku connection which was listed as "poor" also shot up immediately to "excellent". Now my connections just fly and my wireless router no longer drops every few days the way it had been. I also walked through the house and discovered even more networks near to me that had been impacting my bandwidth. This is an excellent application and I wholeheartedly recommend it. You don't have to be a geek to use the app, btw. It's simple to use as it offers multiple graphical views which in turn makes it easy to understand the information displayed.

This nice little app allowed me to walk around all 3 floors and make sure we were putting the router in the right place, correct height,  and best angle to get a stable, strong connection throughout the house. I even checked outside to make sure I could sit in the backyard or on the front steps and use my wireless devices. Once the router was properly position my signal on the WiFi Analyzer was a perfectly straight line on the graphs and well into the "Green"=Strong signal on the signal strength indicator. I like that you can view your signal in a variety of ways on the graphs and also use the signal strength indicator while walking around. Good solid app, very useful. Now I will also be able to find the places where the signals are the strongest outside of McDonald's or Starbucks too. Oh, and it also shows you what channels you get the strongest signals on so you can change your router to use the channel with the best signal for your location.

I started "losing strength" a couple of nights ago (the bars went from 5 to 1) and, with a business network account, this just shouldn't happen. But I used the Wi-Fi Analyzer and sure enough, mine was one of the weakest of six networks in the area. Then I noticed a pattern: always weaker at night. Last night, I had to "reinstall" the connection, and today it was confirmed by my provider that they've been having problems. The Wi-Fi Analyzer got me a one-month credit! (Results may vary: I've been with the same provider for 5 years.)

This can also sniff out even those networks that are supposedly hiding its ID from broadcasting (like mine) so those networks better make sure they're secured.  Can't say I would recommend it, but it's free and maybe it will have a particular use to other people as well so go for it.

The router was on the floor about 50 feet and two walls away from the big screen TV where I wanted to stream Netflix videos in HiDef through the Kindle Fire HD 8.9". It turned out my signal was a little weak at that end of the house. By simply raising the router to eye-level in the room where it is installed I increased the signal substantially. I've also used this to find and measure open WiFi networks accessible on my Kindle from parking lots where I was waiting for my wife to finish shopping. It's a useful and interesting tool. WiFi analytics Tool also works, but I preferred the displays on this app.

Gives other channels that are better but I can't figure out how to get a better channel.  So, for a not so techy person, I gave it 3 stars.  Maybe someone with more knowledge would know what to do with this other than what I can do...........which is pretty much nothing.

I work with it regularly, pretty much a weekly basis, trying to determine if a signal is strong enough or if there are ways to make it better.

Using this app I was able to configure the twelve networks we have here in our college housing apartment complex so they don't conflict with each other, so they have the best signal strength possible, and much more. Everyone here who uses our WiFi saw a huge improvement, and it was thanks to this app. And it's free. You really can't beat that. Five stars.

The first time I ran it on my Kindle Fire, it "saw" more wifi networks around my house than my laptop PC sees, which is probably a testament to both the app and the Kindle Fire's wifi receiver. I made a test drive down a nearby street that has many hotels, restaurants, and other businesses that have wireless networks, and Wifi Analyzer picked up dozens of signals.The five different views that you can select from are all useful to some degree, but my favorite views are "AP list" and "Channel rating." AP list shows all the wireless networks around me and their relative signal strengths, and Channel rating shows the different channels of the network that I'm connected to. I learned that there are stronger channels than the default channel that I was using.It doesn't take a tech geek to figure it out. The graphical interfaces are easy to read and understand.I plan to take my Kindle Fire with me when I travel, and Wifi Analyzer will be extremely helpful in finding and connecting to a strong, stable wifi network. I think this is a "must have" app if your Kindle Fire (or other wifi tablet) leaves your home.

I have found this great APP named WIFI Analyzer that is free and it is a great tool.  It offers multiple screens that can provide an analysis of your WIFI strength as well as all the WIFI systems around your house.  It provides sound engineering data on how well your network is performing.  It will even tell you which channels are the most open and best for you to choose as well as the signal strength of your network and all others:Screen 1 is a WIFI spectrum analyzer map showing all the area networks (including yours) and what bands they are using and the signal strength.  My WIFI booms at -45 to -55 DB ( a very good signal strength) all over my house and yard and it allows very fast and good access.Screen 2 gives you an analog meter that will provide you with accurate strength readings of your WIFI.Screen 3 provides a bar graph of your network and all of the surrounding networks and their signal strength.Screen 4 tells you which channel you are on and which channels in your area provide the best open reception so you can reprogram your wireless router and improve your WIFI performance.Screen 5 provides signal strength versus time recording so you can monitor your WIFI to make sure it is stable and if any neighbor is walking on your WIFI.This APP is a great tool and allows you to walk around your home and monitor your signal strength and look for dead zones and problem areas where other WIFI systems may be causing you trouble.  It can even help you aim and align your WIFI antenna for optimum performance.  I would strongly suggest you try this APP.  You can stop the guess work and use this APP on your Kindle Fire to check out your WIFI with a real measuring tool.

But I have lowered my rating to 2 stars, because of a problem on its 5G coverage---the 5G channel 165 is missing! [I might have to raise it back though, if my Kindle Fire HD 8.9" is the real problem.]At our home to improve signal quality and throughput I have switched everything to run on 5G directly or through ethernet connections to 5G-extenders. Then it was when I discovered this missing channel problem. On my computer using the program InSSIDer 4, I clearly see three signals. One emanates from my main router and two come from our two Roku 3 units. [After e-mails with the Roku people and experimentation it appears that the Roku-3 remote works either on a separate 5G (access point) signal if the Roku-3 is ethernet connected or over the users 5G wireless if it is wirelessly connected]. In our case the two Roku-3's have found channels 149 and 165 over which to operate, while our router operates over 5G signal on channel 157.With WiFi Analyzer, if one finds the hidden box near the upper left of the graph, just below the icon, it reveals the signal one is using as a box for a 2.4 or 5G signal label. Clicking that switches bands. On my Kindle Fire HD 8.9" a strong signal seen with InSSIDer 4 on my computer with both computer and the Kindle Fire HD 8.9" fire physically essentially at the same location, that signal at ch 165 is completely missing. While I honestly don't yet know whether the problem involves this app or some hidden flaw in the Kindle Fire HD wireless range, clearly something is wrong that wireless channel 165 signal is missing using the Kindle Fire HD 8.9".Can anyone else duplicate the missing channel 165 problem with their Kindle Fire HD 8.9" or any other device, so as to identify what might be this problem?The above said, perhaps I should raise my rating a bit, because the otherwise similar "Amped wireless" Wi-Fi Analytics Tool cannot display my 5G band signals at all. Strangely though it actually reports my ch 157 5G signal and my 149 ch 5G Roku in its listings, just not the ch 165 Roku, making one wonder if my Kindle Fire HD 8.9" is the real problem. I guess time might answer this problem?

Within a few minutes this app gave me enough information to solve my problems!The two most useful parts of the display were the channel spread per access point, and the signal strength. The channel spread showed me that I'd picked the same channel for my wireless network (11) as my neighbors, which was causing conflicts. I moved to channel 3 and there was no longer spectrum overlap. Also, another display showed the DB strength of my wireless signal, which made me realize that the placement of my router is less than optional. Not bad for 10 minutes with an app I used with a wireless deployment I've had for months.If you're experienced with wi-fi, this is a useful diagnostic tool. If you're NOT experienced with wi-fi, this might still show you some interesting info. I recommend it!

In Method 2 &#62;&#62; Setup via Web Browser in Step 3 you are directed to a web site to complete the process. That web site is for sale. The Tech Support number takes you to China and while they were helpful in getting me set up, they are more demanding and fast paced than I prefer.If your router has a WPS button to connect devices to your network this is a good device at a good price.

Having said that, I would pay for the app later if they came out with a Pay version.  I am very visual and it immediately showed all the WiFi connections in my block.  It has several screens that show the information in graphic format and one screen that shows the strength in a full screen "Vu Meter".  This helps with the Kindle finding a sweet spot in the house.  I am using it on a new Kindle "Fire" and it does not appear to have any problems at all.  Another real nice feature is that it shows on one of the color screens the channel you, and others are on.  This helps as I was able to move to the "high end" on my router while most of the others in my area were clustered around the low area.  Once again ... very nice, visual, application for use with my new Kindle Fire.  Thank you

Too many times in the past I would throw money at a problem and hope it went away. Sometimes I got lucky and sometimes I wasted my money. With this for the specific problem of signal drop it was not a matter of luck - the app showed the real problem.Granted the root cause of a signal problem is beyond the scope of this meter, but it's nice to know whether or not a problem exists with the signal strength or the receiving nodes on a Wi-Fi network. Moreover, this is a wonderful tool for determining the optimal channel to select if you truly want to control multiple networks without conflicts.I loved the different display types that allowed me to select the best view of what was appropriate to measure, and the fact that I could cycle through them with a simple finger swipe as though I were browsing photos.  I found the simple meter to be the most useful for surveying signals and the needle reacted to my moving away from the router as well as obstructions like cinderblock walls with no latency.After I set use this to solve a real problem I played around with it in my own home and found some surprising dead spots where I never suspected any existed, plus some decent signal reception where I thought it would drop off to poor quality. Apparently Wi-Fi signals are fickle, but this meter enabled me to accurately map out my own network signal strength throughout my property. It also showed how crowded the frequencies are from other neighboring devices.The important thing, though, is this installed quickly and is not only fast, but reliable. Unlike other apps I have downloaded for free this has a professional feel and is stable. For the record I am using this on a Samsung Galaxy Note II running Android 4.2.1.

It's also critically helpful when setting up and configuring your network.As an example, I just set up a new dual-band wireless router in our home.  It operates in the 2.4GHz and 5GHz band range.  I had no ability to know what channel to configure our router for each band.  The router was set to autoconfigure the channel for each band, but I wanted to see what activity was happening on all the bands.  I loaded this app, which gave me the ability to view the channels.  I was able to see all the routers in the homes around me, their names, and what channels they were operating on.  Interestingly, the default for many routers is channel 6 on the 2.4GHz band.  I found three other routers working on top of the channel my router was automatically running on.  I then moved our router to channel 1, which only had one other router weakly running on that channel.I then went to look at the dB level (signal strength) for both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands and physically moved the router to a location that provided the best range in our living space.  This location happened to have the router mounted to the ceiling joist in the utility room, which is in the lower level of our home (the ceiling is open in this room, which enabled us to mount the router on the joist).  This is the central-location of our home.  The meter view enabled me to walk around the house and see what the dB level was at different locations.  This enabled me to figure out where to place the router for the best signal strength.The app provides different views to enable you to see how your wireless router is running.  It will recommend a channel for your router to run on, based on what it sees.  These different views are extremely helpful and interesting to watch.Another example: I'm able to adjust the mW signal strength our wireless router is configured to run at.  I wanted a booming signal, so I set it to the highest rating, which is 200mW.  I found I was getting a lot of pixelation when streaming video on the 5GHz band, which confused me.  I thought setting the router at 200mW would give us a great signal with clean video streaming.  I was wrong.  I then looked at this app to see what both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands were doing.  It provides a view that shows the signal strength of all the routers it sees on a moving graph as time ticks by.  So you can see all the wireless signals over a two minute period (or whatever time it's set at, I forget) and see how your router is functioning at each band.  I noticed at 2.4GHz my signal would periodically rise up and then drop down to a lower setting.  When it would rise up, the 5Ghz signal would drop to nothing for a few seconds!  I didn't know why that was happening, but that was the reason I was getting a pixelated video stream.  The 5GHz signal would be fine, then drop out, then go back to operating fine, then drop out, etc.  Through trial and error and watching the router activity through this app, I was able to determine that the maximum signal strength I should configure the modem at in my location was 100mW.  When I set it to this level, both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands were happy and I no longer had any pixelation when streaming video; the 5GHz signal stopped dropping out.This is an excellent app for those just curious to see how their wireless router is functioning and for peaking at other routers in your area.  It's also an outstanding and essential tool for those who need to configure their own router.  Highly recommended!

You can place your wifi on the channel that is used the least to avoid interference.  Just walking around the room with this thing is pretty interesting.  Driving down the road with it is even more fun.  I'm not sure how the other functions are used but the spectrum display is all anyone would need.  The screen gets really crowded in town.  The only improvement I could see would be to have the option to highlight the open systems so that you can pick them out of the crowd.

I was amazed how much difference it made with the Wi-Fi signal after re-positioning the router just few feet higher of it's original place. I love the different visual options and audio beeps from the app that makes your work easy to read the signal strength and also different recommendations as to which channel is less crowded in your area.I can see it very useful for anyone who roams a lot with their kindles and want to find the best Wi-Fi in the locality.Super useful. Now ... I wish it could also detect leaking pipes around the house :-)Five Stars! Kudos to the Developer and making this app FREE!

Everyone in a neighborhood running on channel 11 or 6 or nn is not good.  Its also useful to determine the type of encryption being used by the various networks before trying to connect to a network.  I also use it to determine which band on my dual-band network gives me the greatest signal strength when I'm in the far away rooms of my house so I can connect to the strongest.

Very cool to be able to SHOW someone why their network doesn't work very well. Very responsive receiver and graphics and the response rate can be changed in the settings. Like many aps, you have to take the time to explore. Much of what makes it valuble require you to change some of the settings to refine what you are seeing. The only improvement I could suggest is more clarification on looking at 2gHz versus 5gHz signals. But for what it does it is outstanding!

Once you find the best channel (during peak hours in the evening, set your channel to the one least used and you will be happy)Helps when out on the town as well trying to decide which public wifi signal to tap into.Enjoy and be sure to tell others of this great app.

Bothered by signal loss and such that seemed to become far worse around Christmas morning?  One display provided by this app can let you know part of why that might be happening; the scan of and display of the wifi channels it sees within range of your device.  You may find, as I did, that your neighbors added a bunch of wireless routers and guess what?  They're all on channel one (1)!  Even out in the woods where I live this can spell trouble.  At the very least you're likely to find that all of them seen within range of home are jammed in the first three or four channels (of the 14 available in the lower frequency band of 2.4GHZ and NONE are on the 5GHZ band).  Putting your own router up on one of those unused channels could be a simple way of avoiding interference and dropouts, etc.  A useful tool to have around on any handheld device for sure.

I'm not exactly a puzzle person, but I got it for free while they were having a special. If you're not a puzzle person, DON'T GET IT. I mean, I don't regret getting it, but that's because I got it for free. If you don't like puzzles, then it's definitely not worth paying for. And for everyone who's complaining about it not having a colorblind option, what do expect? I'm sorry, but there's a MINORITY of colorblind people in America. They're not gonna make a whole other game that like, 10% of Americans would buy because they're colorblind. Also, if you're colorblind and you bought a Kindle Fire, if you have any sense to think ahead, you wouldn't have gotten one for apps, because most apps have color in them. Believe it or not, Kindle Fires were made for people to read.

It plays well on my gTablet (running Vegan-Tab 7.1). Sure, it's not flashy, but it is challenging and the ability of being able to change the speed of the game is a nice feature.

Graphically, it's ok, and scaled all the way up to use the full 10" screen of the gTablet. The background music is decent, adding to the ambiance of the game rather than detracting from it. Control is done through tapping the connectors to change the direction the fire will travel along. It sounds pretty simple, and it is, but each new level adds complexity. More colors, more connectors, more receivers, etc. The difficulty level selection is done by adjusting the speed of the game. I like the way they do this, which is with a slide bar instead of a few predefined speeds. Dragon Fire lacks a score mechanism or any other way of tracking how well you did other than by completing the level. If there is such a thing in the game, I missed it, and there isn't a help section to clarify things. The base game is good, but the app as a whole lacks depth found in similar games.I hope you found this review helpful, and if not, feel free to leave comments/questions.

Works very well on the Kindle Free.You need to operate switches to get blobs of differently-colored fire to a color-matched home. The speed control is a very nice feature. You can take it on the slow side and it can be quite relaxing. I can only guess at how hectic it would be a full speed! You can adjust the volume for the music and the sound effects. Incidentally, the music and sound effects are fine and not annoying.This is a very solid 4-star plus game; however, I went up to 5 stars to counter some of the earlier negative reviews, which I felt were not justified.

I like the style of the game, and the sound effects are solid.  But what I like the most about the game is how hectic it can get.  Within a few levels, you are having to move at lightning speed and are trying to juggle a few different colors at once, and it can get pretty difficult.I enjoy playing it, and overall, I think it's a solid product.

You have to guide the colored dragon fire to the same color vessel or you lose a life.  The game starts off slow and gets more and more difficult.  It is good that you can slow down the speed of the colored fire to practice a few times before the real tough stuff starts.The game was challenging and fun to play but it does get difficult fast.  I am not sure that I will ever finish it.  It is a real time consumer.  This will not become one of my favorite games as I like other styles but overall it is fun for a while.

After all that time, it's refreshing to come across something new. In this game you're directing colored bursts of dragon's fire (that looks remarkably like drops of paint) through a series of valves you control, to a reservoir of the same color. The trick is figuring out the right combination of valve settings to dispose of each burst.Pro:+ In my experience, a new kind of game and relatively fun+ Nice graphics and sound+ Many different levels to play through, similar to advancement through a game like 'angry birds'Con:- I'm embarassed to say, I haven't quite gotten the hang of it yet, it's a little hard.This is a high quality game, and as I said earlier, is a new kind of game, at least in my experience. It's not as groundbreaking as something like Tetris or Myst or Wolfenstein 3D was, but it's not just another puzzle game either. Definitely worth a shot!Note: I got this as the free app of the day and played it on my Kindle Fire.

Judging by the reviews I thought it might suck, but it just goes to show the level of intelligence &amp; competence on here. (&amp; I'm not talking about superman75, either. Keep on trolling as far as I'm concerned! You're funny &amp; entertaining, &amp; a good break from the moronic ranting that's usually on here.)This game is definitely not just a remake of  one of the same old crap games circulating on the android market. It's something new that's hard enough to make it a challenge, but not so hard that it's not enjoyable. For a casual game I like it, &amp; if I cared to play casual games I'd definitely keep it around.Game play goes something like this:  There are several things that look like pots...some that have colors on them, &amp; some that have arrows. Each pot has openings on a couple different sides. A dragon breathes colored fire towards one of the pots with an arrow on it. You have to direct the colored fire to the same colored pot by pointing the arrows in the correct direction. It will go in one opening &amp; out the other to the next pot you're aimed at. Once the colored fire gets into its colored pot, the pot will close &amp; is done. The aim is to close them all without getting wrong colors into the wrong pots. Depending on what level you're on, there can be a lot of arrows &amp; once you get one color into its pot, it changes color several times before it's done &amp; closes. The game progresses quickly, but isn't as hard as it first looks. It does get quite challenging afterwhile, though, which is always good.Overall, definitely a good game for any casual gamer. Anyone with any intelligence won't be disappointed!

Only I hid my phone so I could play on it while I waited.As we all sat around listening to my pastor quote scripture and trying to find the International Space Station, I asked if I could go off to use the restroom.I was excused with blessings.So, I snuck off and retrieved my phone, and out of curiosity downloaded the FAotD.I guess I got caught up in my game and was gone awhile, because like a thief in the night, suddenly there was my pastor hovering over me and questioning me on what I had and how in the heck did I get it up the mountain. I explained that it was my phone and that I was playing Dragon Fire which was a really cool game and that I had hid it in my pocket. After glancing me over, he immediately began to speak in tongues.Then we saw the light.Coming up the mountain, from the same dirt road that we had come, was an extremely bright light, several in fact. Upon seeing the lights, my pastor stopped throwing dirt on himself, jumped up, and running towards the lights began to yell, "He has come! He has come!"And then everyone went running. Towards the lights.I don't think that frenzied naked mob would have heard Jesus himself warning them from behind.Anyways, it turns out the lights were actually the FBI, we were trespassing on federal property, and my pastor was wanted for tax evasion.And yet the whole thing was somehow the result of my transgression. Go figure.

It was nice to be able to slow down the fireballs for certain levels so I could keep track. Even on the slowest setting some of the levels could still be pretty challenging at first. I played this on Kindle Fire. Probably would be harder on a small phone.Only thing that keeps it from being a 5 star is that there aren't enough levels. I finished the whole thing in a couple of hours. I also wish there was some bonus for finishing every level with a perfect score.

I'm a photo junkie and I have accounts on Picasa and SkyDrive in addition to Flickr, and I have the Snapwood app to view the pics on those as well (check out thePortfolio for Windows SkyDriveandPicFolio for Picasa Web Albums).  With these apps available there is no reason to waste time with the glitch-filled stock Gallery app that comes with the Kindle Fire, and no reason to load up the Fire's limited internal memory with photos.The best thing about Flickr is that it is the only online photo site I've found that reads and organizes my photos by the keyword-tags I've already entered for them on Windows, and the best thing about FlickFolio is that it also lets me view photos by tags on my Kindle.  No more endless searching for the pics I want.The FlickFolio app is fast and easy to use and so far, glitch free.One last thing.  Many months ago when I first got the Picasa app from the same developer (PicFolio) I had a problem.  I wrote to Snapwood and got a reply almost immediately and my problem solved.  That kind of service from an app developer is priceless.

I have to say I really loved the service as it made my life very simple.Fast forward a few years, and I had to update my phone to the Iphone 5s.  It has been all downhill from there.I never could get the software to sync with my new iPhone.  I sent dozens of emails to customer service.Finally, I got some instructions to help me transfer my cell phone Splash, onto my desktop, then onto my new iPhone.Don't ask...just don't do it.  Seriously, if I did not have a backup of all my information, it would all be gone now.  The company told me the version I had do splash was just too old and I should have known to buy a newer version...are you kidding me?!?  I am not a techie person by nature, so I had assumed they would be updating me automatically. Or at least sending me the information if there was a critical upgrade.  So, all data was lost.I gave them some points because for the years I used it, I really loved it.  But what is the point of this kind of password protector if you can lose all your passwords?

It doesn't offer as much GUI distractions as some of the other password storage programs, so it does look/feel dated.  However, when combined with the new desktop manager, I still cannot imagine life without it.  If you are carrying over an old .VID file, the new one requires a lot of patience to properly import everything.  Splash Data's customer service was helpful to fix some of my mistakes.

In the past, my biggest complaint was syncing between desktop and external device. With wifi sync, those problems have gone away.I have the Mac desktop version, the PC desktop version, Blackberry version, and now the Android version for my Kindle Fire. In the past, syncing was a pain, won't detail it here, but suffice to say I didn't do it often because it was so annoyingly klugy. I used one computer as the main place to update my password info. Now with the addition of wifi sync, it's great. No problems syncing between 2 Mac desktops, my BB and my  Fire. Haven't fired up my PC to see if it works as well, but given how well it works with the other platforms, I wouldn't expect problems.A bit about the program itself--You set a password that you must enter before the program will open. You can also set a time that the program will remain open before logging you out so you need to re-enter the password.There are many choices for type of information to record. For example, credit card, bank account, web logins, etc. Each of these forms has fields that are specific to that sort of record. If you enter a URL, [...] you can click on the link and it will open in your default browser. You can even customize the fields, I believe, but I haven't done that, don't need to.I can't really compare it to other password programs, since I've used SplashID exclusively for quite awhile. I certainly recommend this program given its ease of use and syncing on multiple platforms, and the many different kinds of information it will allow you to record.

When I got my KF, SplashID was one of the first things I installed. I was really disappointed when it did not sync with my SplashID desktop installed on my PC. I gave up using it for the time being, but with the new release of version 6.1, everything works perfectly now. Thanks!

I have the app on my iPhone 4S, Nexus 2013, iPad 3 and Dell laptop. My laptop serves as the &#34;master list&#34; and it's very easy to sync any of my devices with my laptop to keep track of any additions or changes. I sync via wifi.The app lets you create your own categories and supplies ample fields for all of your information. This is one of my favorite and most used apps.

It has been easy to use. Synchronizing between platforms has been good but not perfect. Version 6 wireless synchronous works very well, better than previous versions.The interface in this version takes some time to learn but is pretty good. After using version 4 for a few years, I've had difficulty finding some functions and features but no serious issues.The big problem with this version is that the App locks every time I switch to another App. I open SplashID Safe,  enter the password, get a password for a web site, switch to the browser and then return to SplashID only to find I must enter the password again even if only a few seconds passed since I entered it.SplashData tech support says the lockout delay was removed for security reasons. They are working on a solution to add the lockout delay back into the App. The Aneroid App is practically useless to me if this defect is not corrected.

It's got lots of interesting scientific data about moon position and such, but I honestly don't see myself using this very much.  I'm sure a hobbyist astronomer would find this more interesting.

The image of the moon shows both sides of it.  It also shows the different phases as the beautiful moon waxes and wanes.  It also has a ton of technical information which goes right over my head but looks very cool.  There is also a calendar that shows where the phases each in every day, past to future.  I have it as my wallpaper and I am never bored with it.  I am totally satisfied with this app.

It would be cool if the stars twinkled.

Besides making good "Wallpaper", this is great for planning star gazing nights since you can see if the moon is going to be bright. The "Cheese Mode" is fun, but I will not be using it regularly.The app installs and runs perfectly on my HTC EVO and Kindle Fire.Highly Recommended!CFH

I was curious to see how this would look on a tablet, since I didn't see any other tablet reviews.It looks like it might have a couple of minor bugs. One thing I noticed is how responsive the developer has been, even commenting on reviews. It sounds like bugs brought to his attention will be taken care of quickly. It would be nice to see more developers like this.

It provides detailed information about the moon phase, as well as a beautiful, detailed image in the main app. Loads quick, no issues on my HTC Amaze (Gingerbread 2.3.4). Turning on the detailed shadows brings the image alive....But wait there's more -- you can interact with the image, dragging the phase and seeing what day that will be. Changing the date to go forward or back in time. Dragging the image to see the dark side of the moon. It's fun!But wait there's more -- Moon Phase Pro provides a Live Wallpaper that turns my HTC Sense lock screen into a changing image of the moon. (It's a shame to hide it under home screen widgets and icons.)But wait there's more -- the app gives you several dynamic home screen widgets, with or without data at a tap. So much for that last bit. ;) )I like this app, and heartily recommend it.

Without even trying, you can have so much fun and learn a lot about our nearest neighbor. You have to try "cheese mode" if your feeling hungry. Once your done with the moon, then you can play with your own galaxy withGravilux.

You are able to create whatever moon phase you like.  The accompanying data is interesting for anyone who might need it.  The ability to use this as live wallpaper is a nice touch.CONS: As live wallpaper, the changes are (obviously) gradual.  For all the memory and CPU live wallpaper consumes, it would be nice to see something happening.  Despite all the PROS, this is not an app I think anyone would use every day, or even very often, and probably wouldn't be left on one's phone/tablet for very long.  Of course, as previously mentioned, the app asks for far too many permissions for what it does.BOTTOM LINE: This app falls into my category of "very cool / not useful".  What it does, it does well; however, what it does isn't useful enough to me to warrant a permanent place on my phone or tablet.  I installed it, played with it for 20 minutes, got bored, and uninstalled it.Nevertheless, kudos to the developer for putting together a nice app.  Interested to see what's next.

Ha ha. I love this brilliantly-constructed and informative app.When you first open it, you're treated to a high-definition image of the moon as it appears from your location, displaying the correct phase, moon face, and phase shadow angle. To accomplish that, the app uses either your coarse or fine (GPS) location. That alone is pretty cool, but there's much more to this app than just that. Slide your finger left and right across the screen, and the moon changes phases, displaying the date and time it will be at that phase. The displayed Moon even rotates accordingly.There is an available information screen that provides all sorts of information about the current Moon, including altitude, azimuth, right ascension, declination, distance, dates of apogee and perigee, and Moon rise and set times and compass locations.Using two fingers, you can take full command of our closest astronomical neighbor, spinning it around to see every part of it, including of course the incorrectly-named "dark side" that we poor earthbound saps never get to see.With one finger press, you can also alternate between the next full- and new-moon displays, with the number of days and hours until those occurrences happen displayed with the image.You can also set this app to permanently display the current Moon as a live wallpaper.Clicking your device's "back" button re-orients the moon display to the current proper phase and orientation for your location.You can also input any date you wish to see what the Moon looked like on that date. On the day I was born almost 50 years ago, the Moon was 62% full (waning gibbous). Cool!You can also pop up a calendar-style graphic that shows a mini-photo of the Moon for every day of the current month (you can see any month by swiping the display or pressing forward and reverse icons). pressing on a calendar day adjusts the main display to that day's Moon appearance.This is an amazingly informative and very entertaining app. Well thought-out and the professional-level user interface is clean, logical and uncluttered. Even if it may not have much practical value in my everyday life, for 99 cents I still think it was well worth it.

This is a great app for timing the right nights to do it (the moon is best taken a picture of when it isn't full), and the sky when it is a new moon. It is easy to use and informative. Highly recommended for astronomers.

Wether used as a reminder to stock up on razors, or go down and chain yourself into the room you've built, or your simply programming the lock on the steel door with the upcoming dates to lock and of course unlock and let you out, you'll find Moon Phase Pro to be a pretty useful app.  Simply clicking on the little calendar icon in the tool bar type area in the top left of the app shows with illustrations on a monthly calendar the different phases of the moon, and importantly when it's full.You don't have to log into the app every day either, as it sends nice little updates to your Kindle Fire HD's notifications page.  If you do want to log into the app, nicely there is no requirement to be connected to Wi-Fi, the app works fine in the airplane mode.  Really there's not a great deal this app does.  It's a simple showing you what the moon looks like at the moment app.  Sure you can just look up a the sky for this usually but it is overcast sometimes, and remember you can look at the app in the day too.  The moon is displayed in a nice 3D looking sphere that rotates with your finger showing shadows, the surface of the moon and everything thing else you would see on a clear cloudless night by looking up.  If you're into knowing the exact percentage of waxing crescent, what time it will rise on a specific date, when the last full moon occurred and when the next will all appear on the load up page.  Be careful though, you'd expect swiping with your finger to the right would show the future moons, but not so.  This actually takes you back in time (maybe you're comparing mysterious half eaten body discoveries in the newspaper with the estimated time of death and wondering if this could have been done by you), other than that there's not much use for what the moon did look like so you'll want to remember swiping the screen to the left shows the moon's phase in the future.  Of course clicking on the calendar link in the tool bar is even easier and lessens your chance of making a mistake.

Unless, you're a NASA scientist, I can't think of a single thing that this app doesn't provide.  And, in the process of providing this great information this app also makes it extremely easy to find and use.  I love the intuitive way you navigate on this app to enter your specific location and other "what if" information.  I was literally up and enjoying this app within less than five minutes.Who knows...when I become a NASA scientist maybe I won't like this app, but until then I'm going to stay inside (you go out in the cold MichaelH) and enjoy all the neat stuff this app has to offer!

The graphics for the moon are superb, and as a background it simply looks amazing.When it comes to the rest of the app, I don't really know much about moon phases, but it seems to be solidly written and works very well.Overall, for what I'm using it for, it's definitely a five star app.

On the main screen it shows you what the moon will be like today.  You have to enter in your location to get accurate information.  What I like is that by touching the calendar symbol at the top you get a monthly calendar and it shows the lunar status for every day of the upcoming month.  You can even look months ahead.  If you touch a day the lower  of the screen provides a larger view of the moon on the day you selected.By touching the data button you can review all of the lunar activity for that day with all of the scientific data provided to you.  The place button wants you to enter you location to provide you accurate lunar data.  You also have a clock function in order to advance the data or time to see the changes in the view of the moon.I gave this app 5 stars for the quality of the data provided and its uniqueness. It is interesting!

And, if they did, I never would have dreamed they would make such a *beautiful* app. You enter your location, and it renders the current phase of the moon for where you are, and indicates when it rises and sets. It even rotates the image of the moon to compensate for your location: wicked!Pro:+ Simple, elegant user interface: moon set / rise for any day, and the portion of the moon 'full', as well as the ability to drag the shadow and be told what day / time it will look like that.+ The picture of the moon and the shadow are amazingly well done. I stared at it for a while just to enjoy it.+ I could see this being useful for those who have to care about the phase of the moon, e.g. those following a lunar calendar.Con:- None. Beautiful app!I am using this on my Kindle Fire and got it for free. I may refer back to it to see when the moon is full and when it will be visible on the days it is: Seeing the full moon as it's rising at night is romantic, at least to me :)

It asks for your city and state so you get the exact phase and view. I love to turn the moon and watch the different phases thru the year. It doesn't use drawings or sketches but actual views of the moon itself!

My father even had a garden competition with his father to try to prove this was wrong.  His garden looked great.  Bushy, leafy. Healthy. But not much crop.  His dad's garden looked punier but bore like crazy--an abundance of green beans, great looking corn, cucumbers, tomatoes.  The fact that planting by the phases of the moon might have that kind of effect fascinates me.  And being only a so-so gardener, I can use all the help God can give.  This was a Christmas freebie.  It offers information on moon phases.  Garden season is approaching.  Here's hoping this helps!

However, I seem to have a curiosity on the phase of the moon. This program does that. It even has some other features such as a calendar to show what phase of Moon will be in on a particular day of the month.There are a few things that were a little rough around the edges. This program can be moved to the SD card. This is a very important feature, since most of my tablets are of the older variety and is good to make room on the main flash drive. The first time I ran this program on the card, it really didn't want to work. But that was the only time that it complained. It has fired up correctly since then. It does not show correctly what part of the moon is lit up, though the amount that seem to be correct.So, it is something to play around with, and doesn't take any space on the main memory.

The developer is now aware that it shows waning gibbous for today (1/8/12) and it only seems to affect today. He is working on a fix for it. If you're guess that means you get a quick reply from the Dev, you'd be absolutely correct.The app works beautifully on my Droid 2 Global and I had no issues with it freezing. However, I did use the back button to exit out and not the home button. Overall, between quick developer response and the very slick, nicely done app, can't help but give this little darling a 5 star. If you like having the phases of the moon at your fingertips, this is the app for you and with it being FAOTD? You can't lose. ;)

I use it to track when to stay off the roads as the lunatics come out during the full moon. Incredible amount of data supplied each day. I actually look at it each morning because ethe graphics are cool.

Got it on the faotd, but worth the money if I was looking for a solution to monitoring moon phases for say...fishing excursions! Nice live desktop wallpaper too. I'll seasonally change my wallpaper, but always come back to this one.

If you never knew (or cared) much about the moon before, this app will make you want to learn and see more. Love being able to change my location and see the view from other places on the planet. Cool info about the sun, too. Very nicely done.

The graphics are so amazing, it's like you are at space camp looking at the moon through a telescope. You can see it with several different graphics settings too. It's so cool to turn the moon with my stylus or fingers, on my Kindle Fire HD, to view all sides of the moon. It even adjusts the date and time, when you spin it to accurately display the time your hemisphere will or did see the moon from that angle. There is also a calendar button so you can view the different moon phases for each day of the previous, current, and future month(s). Love it! And it's really only 70&cent; with the 30&cent; credit Amazon gives. Totally worth 70&cent; if you are into the moon or it's phases/cycles.

This app brings back fond memories of the times l had with that old scope.  As nice as it looks on my Galaxy 3, the way it looks and runs on my new Kindle Fire HD is even better.  Be sure and switch to the dynamic imaging to get better pictures of the lunar surface.  The "Cheese" mode is kinda cute (albeit useless)as well.

You can use any lat/long service really. The only issue is if you are traveling and want to know the phase of the moon, remember to get the lat/long before leaving or checking the phase of the moon. With GPS on your phone, it always knows where you are (and you can always manually change the location as well, in case you want to see what the phase of the moon is when your significant other is traveling to Germany and you're in California or something).Good stuff and a great price if you have the need!

If you need that information, or just want to have it because it's a fun fact, than this is the program for you.  The only problem is, that it's not a day planner.  You could have the same thing hanging on your wall, except on a wall callendar, you can write things with your pen on.

One page and you know what stage the moon is in, how long until the new full or new moon, all within a second. If the moon phase is important to you - get this app.

At any given time I can know exactly how the moon will look on what day. It also will give you a view of the moon on a monthly calendar. I have this app on my phone and also my Kindle Fire HD. Definitely worth it!

A+ on moon graphics, and defendently an A on the moon phase controller, as it needs to be able to have the ability to enter in the light % and degrees from Earth. Trust me, ignore the bad reviews.

Shows the moon's phase and astronomical data or a calendar with date and the phase of the moon. One of the things I like about the calendar is that half and full moon days are highlighted for easy viewing. This program is not a map, and does not identify features. Another program is required for detailed mapping information.

Eliminating all orbs from the field completes the level.  Later levels have you matching 3-4 orbs and stars (count as 2 orbs) to clear them.  The graphics are good and the sound is decent.  Oddly enough, the story is what kept me playing through all 100 levels.  The lack of an ending to that story is the only reason I dock this game a star.

Hexage is known for stunning visuals and innovative game-play twists on strategy genres, and they do not disappoint on this title. I also feel that this game has not received enough credit on its Amazon port, as very few people know about it. In an attempt to give an accurate and easy to view review, here are the pros and cons of the puzzle game "Totemo HD":Pros -*Great Visuals - The graphics in "Totemo HD" are what puts this puzzle game over the top for me. On the Kindle Fire HD, the visuals are breathtaking due to its usage of the High Definition version. The background visuals, the menu screens, and the spirits themselves bring an eerie feeling to this puzzle game. I would say that these visuals bring a feel reminiscent of the zen puzzle game "Quell". Your "guide" and narrator of the game (the totem man; traveling between worlds) is very vibrant and again adds to the ghastly feel of the game.*Easy Controls; Difficult Game - "Totemo HD" paces the game well as you begin to play it by matching the "spirits" in pairs of various numbers (2, 3, ect.) in vertical or horizontal lines. It may seem simple, but the addition of other barricades such as star spirits add to the complexity. Some levels are insanely hard and challenging, which I feel is much better than hundreds of easy levels. The 100 levels in this game will keep you going for a while, and the challenge makes it worthwhile in comparison to some puzzle games that are just too easy for a majority of the time.*Great Accompaniment Soundtrack - The Kindle Fire HD's Dolby Digital Plus sound system seems to make great use of Hexage's soundtrack in their games, and the eerie sounds of "Totemo HD" add to the general feel of the game. With the visuals and music, it creates a wonderfully surreal puzzle playing atmosphere.*Survival Mode - On top of the 100 levels of puzzles, a survival mode pressures you to complete endless amounts of puzzles quickly to keep going, and an online leader board makes this even more enjoyable.Cons -*HD Only(?) - As I have a Kindle Fire HD, I have no problem with paying $1.99 to get a stunning HD puzzle game, but I think this may be a negative aspect for regular Kindle Fire users as "Totemo HD" is the only version of the game in the Amazon App store. Regular Kindle Fire users will not be able to use the HD aspect of this game, sadly, and I would suggest if possible, Hexage, to put a regular port of the game on the marketplace.*Possibly Short - "Totemo HD" currently has 100 levels. I have heard that it previously had only 62, and I am glad that Hexage expounded on the number of levels. To many, this seems to be too few levels, but the difficulty of them (starting VERY early on) makes it longer than one may expect. Even so, I can't imagine this game taking too long for people to beat, but I would recommend playing survival mode or the story again.*No hints - There is no hint system or "pay-to-proceed" system using either real money or in game currency (as there is no in game currency). This may turn some people off, since the levels are difficult. For me, this wasn't a problem.Conclusion -"Totemo HD" is a puzzle game that is hard to pass up. It's challenging, beautiful, and the soundtrack is great for doing these puzzles. I highly recommend this game, and I feel it has gotten far to little recognition on the Amazon Appstore. Check this game out, even if you are only a casual puzzle gamer.

Granted, I only played with it through level 7, but I found that I was quickly getting bored with it. To be fair, I'm not typically a fan of the bubble pop games, so it could be a good game if you do.  The graphics were nice, but I found the totem speak to get old, as he does bad grammar speak.

The graphics are fine, but I've definitely been more impressed with visuals in other games (like Osmos HD or even Hex Defense). The backgrounds seem quite similar to the live wallpaper on my phone. Cool, but not &quot;wow&quot;!The game's instructions are vague in some respects, and the mumbling spirit could use a grammar proofreader (&quot;be awared!&quot;). After completing the first area, and some of the second, I honestly can't see the 5 stars people are giving this app. I mainly downloaded it because I was suspicious of the reviews.

Unfortunately, I find the dialogue extremely annoying and without any options to stop the guy from talking before and after every single level I finally gave up. If you are able to power past that, or even enjoy(?) it, then more power to you. I deleted it after about 15 levels and the seemingly never ending insistent badgering from the narrator.

Sometimes we take turns on each screen, or we help each other work the screen out. To play, you have to join the objects, with none being left over by the end, and if you get it wrong, you just shake the kindle and the level replays. The only issue I have is that as the level changes, it's not always intuitive what you should do, so there's trial and error involved, but even that is pretty fun. We both really enjoy this game.

Hint: The last 2, or 3, ect, left each time when wrong, try to get ride of them first off next time around. Very strange game, makes you feel like: are you trying to release good, or evil?. Good of course or I wouldn't play it. Game gets harder as you advance, and that makes for a great game for me since I love a challenge. Took me forever to pull the game away from my wife, she simply  loves games like this so much!!. Did you know that H-I-4-&infin;?. Well A-Y?Cause life is always EZ, when you SEEK, for all your (Must Have) apps, and information&trade;&hellip; Enjoy all!!.P.S.

It looks  like all the  one star reviews complain that it's &quot;too easy&quot;,- clearly these people didn't play past the first few levels that exist simply to walk you through how to play.  It gets exponentially more difficult farther on.Very pretty.  And joyous day; no ads.Will buy from this developer again.

(Can you say &#34;match-3&#34; or &#34;hidden object&#34;???)  Totemo begins as a very simple concept, but quickly graduates into some extremely challenging levels, all based on math and logic.  There is some &#34;background story&#34; -- though it does not affect the gameplay at all, and frankly is pretty mundane for the most part.  But anyone who likes a logic challenge should enjoy this game.

Basically, you need to remove circles in groups. They have to be in columns or rows. Each level seems to have a couple of "keys" that will help you get started. I didn't need more than one try for a level until I got into the 20s. I find that it is very satisfying to clear a board.The visuals are pleasing. I think that this is a game that I will enjoy playing for a few minutes here and there until I finish it.

You will get stuck on some of the more complicated puzzles but that's the point.

The early levels are fairly easy, but don't let that fool you.  As you progress it takes quite a bit of thought to figure out how to remove all the symbols.  There's no particular reason why I took off a star; I just save 5 star reviews for truly great apps and this one doesn't quite meet that criteria, but it is very good.

Unfortunately, the game is pretty dumb and doesn't really hold interest.  I kept thinking it would improve and get interesting, but it didn't.  A very very young child MIGHT enjoy it.  Otherwise....sorry...not worth purchasing.

Then as the levels get progressively harder, it really does make teens and adults think to clear the board.  I recommend this for anyone that likes matching games.

I totally recommend this app if you like to work that thing that sits between your ears. You know your brain :)The app takes a few boards to get use to.

You have to eliminate rows of demons, but you have to complete it in the right order or all the demons will not disappear. You have to think about your moves before you begin to eliminate.

I already played bejeweled when facebook was new, and that was it for me.  This is about patterns and figuring out how to clear the board utilizing new criteria for how you're allowed to do so with each higher level.  The story/dialogue has always seemed odd and fairly extraneous to me.  But i have played through this game about 4 times, each on a different device.  It is flawless.

The object is to link two or more spirits (dependent on the level) in a row and clear the board. Seems simple, but does get really challenging as you progress as there don't appear to be more than one way to &#34;skin the cat&#34;. Worth a buck or two if you like puzzles.

I can't even get where the description of awesome graphics would come from because I only saw a few objects pictured - an owl -like post, a floating totem guy and some bubbles with eyes that you're supposed to somehow &quot;match &quot;.  I uninstalled.

It actually can. I own more than one HD game and its just as clear as any other game. Now as far as the game goes: it's alright nothing great but not horrible. It's basically a matching game that gets harder as you move along. Kills time but I've played better. And the totem that &quot;talks&quot; to you is neither creepy or cute is straight annoying.

The graphics are very good and cute. The Totem keeps mumbling something or the other in each level as you get acquainted with the rules of the game. You can skip the mumbling if you like. It installed fine on the original 'Kindle Fire' even-though it says "HD" and I am keeping this on my Kindle Fire and play few more levels and update the review later if needed. But for FAOTD I think it is a worth a try. If you are into puzzles and matching games you will like it.Have fun!

It starts off easy but then quickly becomes much more challenging. I've played to level 20 and am starting to feel a little frustrated. The trouble is, there aren't many incentives for solving each level....just more difficulty. Graphics are decent and the game functions smoothly but the story just isn't that interesting or visually appealing.

Even though the levels get tougher, there isn't enough variety in it to capture my attention for more than a few minutes at a time. You match two or three little guys in a row. That's it. It is fun. The graphics are good. It is a beautiful game. It's just simple.

Totemo HD, when playing in Strategy Mode, requires much thought as to exactly how you are going to clear the board. By level 10, that becomes slightly difficult. I am currently on level 25 and it has become increasingly, much more difficult, to the point I've had to restart level 25  seven times and still haven't f found the solution....yet. ;-)The graphics and sound track are awesome. I like the Spirit guide but for me, as I got further into the game and found myself needing to restart levels over &amp; over again, trying to find a solution, I'd get frustrated and that Guide would become less cute each time. LOL There are Options for the music, as well as the sounds in the Menu if you'd prefer to turn them down or, off for better concentration.Any questionable permissions are due to having the option to post your scores to online leader boards,however, I do not see any other excessive permissions for this app that should warrant concern.So, if you enjoy a good strategy puzzle-type game, then I strongly recommend checking this one out as today's FAOTD. It's also worth the asking price for those you that have missed out on the FAOTD
A2QBJ2J8OC3KNN,B004ELSDZK,0.364705882353,0.23998015873,0.0241758241758,0.0,0.084,0.666666666667,TRUTHFUL,Got this as the FAO TD. I thought about being responsible and not downloading it. But when you compare the thrill of freeing lost trapped souls to the mundanity of doing laundry and attempting to get two teenagers too do their chores, this app wins hands down. plus, unlike the said teenagers, the little totem dude actually appreciates all I do for him and his tribe.  If there was a single step undo last move button, I would have given it a fifth star.

The brilliance in this is not in endlessly matching 2, 3 or more rows of identical items, it's the pattern in which you unlock them that is the key to wiping out the entire level.  The little floating guide persona is cute at first but gets kinda boring after a while.  There may be too much backstory wedged into what is in essence an easy to learn but harder to master puzzle.Besides being a thoughtful time waster, the graphics and animations are all buttery smooth and game play is perfectly responsive.  A great effort!
A1YH6DMZOS59A2,B004ELSDZK,1.36470588235,0.618134920635,0.0227963525836,0.000759878419453,0.243,0.714285714286,TRUTHFUL,This is a very unique and challenging game.  You must study the game board carefully and chose your moves with care, because there is only once correct solution.  The object of the game is to link "spirits" in groups of two/three (depending on the level).  The spirits must all be on the same row or column but they don't have to be touching.  This is not a connect-three game!Pros:&#10004; Very unique game concept.  Something I haven't seen before.&#10004; Graphics are great.&#10004; Options to turn off both music and sound.&#10004; You can shake the game to restart the level once you have no more moves (ie: you lost).Cons:&#10008; You have to shake the device really, really hard to get it to restart the game.&#10008; Don't like Totemo's little stories.  Too bad there isn't an option to turn them off.  But there is a "skip" button in the bottom right corner that lets you skip the entire dialog.&#10008; The game can get frustrating (frustrating enough to quit) if you can't solve the puzzle.  A "hint" feature would be nice.&#10008; No scoring.&#10008; There is one little ad that pops up (Radiant Defense).  But the game looks interesting so I might just have to buy it.So in summary this is a great game.  It is wonderful when a developer can come up with something fresh and exciting.  Kudos to Hexage.

Being able to sync the day's goings on with the baby is so helpful, especially if you have one working parent and one stay at home parent or care giver or a child on medication daily that needs to be tracked. I would love to see this app used in a childcare facility. Being able to instantly see what's logged is great to keep everyone feeling like they're involved in baby's day even when they're at work. Granted I haven't used it in months, but the Dev was responsive and even considers user recommendations! Must have for new parents!

I am having twins and already have them setup in my profiles.  =)It is always great to stop in at the pediatrician for a checkup and know the exact answers to those pesky questions:  How many ounces is she eating a day?  How many diapers, on average, a day?  This app shows me all of that in a time frame that I choose!It does so much more!I added all different activities as well.  Pictures and I go on!Enjoy!

I went through the store any downloaded almost every one available.  Needless to say, I stopped (and even deleted everything else after I started using BabyESP.My favorite features are (in no particular order):1) multiple users can input info into the database from different phones (full version must be purchased on both phones, and a web interface is in the works)2) handy journal feature to jot down special notables and a daily picture log as well3) widget that shows elapsed times or times since last ____ (feeding, nursing, diaper, etc)4) very user friendly to modifiy events (adjust start/stop time, amount fed, nursing time, etc.) after the fact even when the timer is still going (as a new parent I found out the baby doesn't wait for you to finish what you're doing before you attend to him)5) great customer support and extremely high level of interest from developers to integrate users' suggestions to improve the app.No bad things that I can think of.  It's a great app at a very reasonable price.

There's no way I play Klondike as badly as this! I've gone under $1,000 twice completing only two games.  It feels like the cards are dealt to frustrate the player. I'm tired of seeing four 4s or three 10s with no place to put them.  With the other Vegas-style Klondike solitaire game with nice cards that I like [Solitaire (free)], my balance after a load of games is -$5, which feels better.  Maybe Klondike more realistically reflects what would happen to me at a casino, but it isn't fun for me.  I'll stick with Solitaire (free).--------------------------------------There are two things I ask of a Klondike-type of solitaire program--Vegas scoring rules and a deck of cards that is easy to read.  Most (but not all!) programs have Vegas scoring, but very few have visually appealing cards.  They are invariably, crude, fuzzy, or just plain unpleasant to look at.  Klondike Solitaire is one of two apps of the nearly dozen I've looked at that satisfy both of my criteria.  The other is Solitaire (Free).  Unfortunately, Amazon system won't let me insert a link to the Amazon page for the other app, but you can find it by using Amazon's search feature.

I actually like this version and have played it while wating for a variety of things. at the car shop, waiting for windows updates, things that take time and we cannot extricate ourselves from, so play solitaire! this version allows not only unlimited undo but if you think &quot;I should have won&quot; you can replay the game. NO the deck won't magically produce the card that would have unlocked your win. but unlike playing cards you may find that &quot;i could've had a V8&quot; move that allows you to win.

I don't like the way the numbers, symbols and letters look. It is different than the one I have on my phone and I can change it on my phone, but it's the same game. I would like it to look the same. It doesn't have the &#34;standard&#34; look, it is very large and I like to whip through the game and it is hard to scan it quickly if your eyes aren't used to it. But I still love this version of the game and I am super glad I got it. It works great on my phone and kindle fire, so problems.

That would be okay, except when the zombie face moves, the unchanged normal face is often visible behind it.All in all, lame.

I'm a sucker for zombies. lol I was sorely disappointed. it uses a single zombie face and even then its not that great. vary it up a bit with different faces and sounds. the sample pic that it comes with looks a ton better than the one the app actually made. On top of all of that you (the developer) should probably remove the base picture after the zombie one is made. you move too far to one side or the other and you can clearly see the picture used. It's a good concept, but needs a LOT of work.

It keeps saying 'authentication failed' whenever we try to add a Twitter account.I've kept the app hanging around on this tablet hoping that they would correct the problem in an update, but apparently that won't be happening -- perhaps because Seesmic is now owned by HootSuite, which has its own app it develops. That's unfortunate because Seesmic is the only Twitter client I know of that has a 'combined view' feature that merges our multiple accounts.

Of course, the official Facebook Android app is so atrocious that a flaming sack of dog feces is preferable. As far as the Twitter functionality of Seesmic, I can definitively say it's great. I've tried a number of different Twitter clients for my Android phone and tablet, and Seesmic was the one I kept coming back to. The timeline is smooth and simple to navigate, managing direct messages and @ mentions is quite convenient, and searching across Twitter is dead simple. It's been over a year now since the folks behind HootSuite acquired Seesmic, but the Seesmic app has (so far) not been effected by that. If you're looking for the solution for using Twitter on your Android device, Seesmic is it.

I liked that Seesmic didn't ask for access to low level system log files (like Tweetcaster does) but disliked that it wanted my GPS data. Seesmic has a nice refresh button. It is hard to tell when something has been retweeted, and by whom. FB integration did not work for this Kindle Fire user, either. I would also have liked the ability to use a darker theme. I am keeping Seesmic and not Tweetcaster mostly for the data access issue.

I can post my status updates easily, message friends, search, and read updates and view pics.  In other words, it does the basics well.  I also like that several posts that I was not seeing with Facebook's app were suddenly appearing.However, I noticed that one of my regular friends suddenly was not available through Seesmic (I checked the website, and she hadn't unfriended me!).  The other thing that I can't find is how to check in from a location).  For me, if those two issues were fixed, the app would get a 5.

It is sort of a bummer that it's not available for the Fire, though.

I regret the screen is for this specific app reduced for cellphones and not customized for tablets. Also the levels are not so great than the original nectaris-pc engine or Turbografx16 neither the PC/DOS version which is my favorite so far however I need to have a DOS emulator to play it. Still this is a very good alternative for mobiles and not so great on tablets. Another alternative is to get the PCE EMU and get the Turbografx rom (if you own it as I do ) but again for a cellphone this is great app

I blew through this game quicker than I should have.If you're used to hitting the "back" button on your Android Phone to back off of controlling a unit it could back-fire since that exits the game without saving.  (takes some getting used to)No network / multi-player.I recently noticed there were "bonus" levels after beating the "final" level by selecting the chose map screen and clicking on the level that appears without the progress road attached.  The final levels, 19 & 20, are actually rather challenging.

But, I have to agree with others that it is fairly easy to defeat the enemy army.(In the Turbo Graphix 16 version it was very hard).

You can add/edit single cards in your existing sets fairly easily too, but...Deleting might become a chore if you've got a lots of cards in one set - currently, as far as I can tell, you can only delete ALL of your existing decks, the current card you're on, or you can "go to" a card number - It would be much nicer if you could scroll through a list of your cards by content (instead of the "go to"), and/or if you could delete a specific selected deck.There is a decent selection of fonts and font sizes available. Background can be switched from lined to plain paper - though it would be good if you could change the background color to something other than white...When you run through a stack of cards, the app uses a "pass/no pass system" i.e., you can flag the ones you are having trouble with, and then just review those specific cards when you are finished. You can also shuffle the cards.Well worth a buck for my purposes.
A24G8O1KZ911TW,B004FG2SKU,0.4,0.425526094276,0.0315581854043,0.0,0.204,0.5,TRUTHFUL,I accidentally moved on to the new card and hadn't finished the one I was on and for like 5 minutes I couldn't figure out how to delete it or edit it, but I FINALLY figure it out. I don't like how my keyboard covers most of the &#34;new card&#34; button when I'm typing and I can't figure out how to get my keyboard to go back down, maybe it's a kindle fire HD issue. Before someone tells me I AM an idiot I do like the app, but I will admit that I feel like my issues are more &#34;user errors&#34; than an issue w/ the app itself, I just got my kindle for Christmas and I'm constantly learning new things about how to do something. But all-in-all I'd recommend it. I'm in college, a senior, and I really benefit from using flashcards, and this is a much easier system than writing out hundreds of notecards and trying to keep them all organized, together but separated from other classes notecards. So I'm hoping this kindle/e-flashcards will be just as beneficial to my learning style as hand written cards are.
A1FW79MF95PIQ1,B004FG2SKU,0.4,0.2,0.02734375,0.0,0.054,0.0,TRUTHFUL,I like that I dont have to waste money on actual flash cards which take up space and I end up losing.

This is a stand-alone program, smooth and easy to use.First, I created some flash cards within the program itself. Easy, but typing on the pop-up keyboard is the most time consuming way to enter information.  It works, but it's slow.Then I made flash cards a second way. I went to a document that I emailed to my Kindle and (1) highlighted several paragraphs of info (2) copied it (3) went back to Flash Cards and pasted the text onto about a dozen cards (4) deleted what I didn't want from each card [I didn't want that much of the same info on every card]. The paste/delete process is quite fast and it was done. Sweet.The very best way: The thought intimidated me, but I read that you could also use a PC to enter flash card information in Excel and upload/convert everything in one stroke. I've never done this, but the thought of such a powerful time-saver compelled me to try. Wow! It's really slick. (1) Going by the example that Flash Cards gives, I entered the quiz info into Excel and saved it as a csv document. (2) I saved it to my desktop and just drug it to my Google Docs a.k.a. Google Drive (get that if you don't have it on your Kindle). Then I (3) grabbed it from Google Docs with my Kindle. Next, I (4) renamed the file as per the Flash Cards instructions and (5) saved it on the SD card. Flash Cards did the rest from the main menu. Lightning fast. Perfect outcome. Too COOL !!Everything else is straight-forward; I could only repeat other reviews. The price is bound to go up as more people discover Flash Cards, so get it now while it's cheap.

I'm a newbie to freecell, but I finally solved my first one after about half a dozen previous attempts.Couple suggestions: allow undo's all the way back to the initial state (currently, I think the undo's are limited to 10 or so ?). Secondly, allow user to move a card from the Aces area back to the tableau -- currently, I think once you stack a card onto one of the aces stacks, it won't let you move it back to the tableau.  These two features are absolutely critical when you need to backtrack in order to find the solution.  When these two issues are resolved, combined with the killer graphics, this will be the app of choice for playing FreeCell.

You walk around by either swiping on your red #, or by using your direction pad, if your phone has one.If you don't bump into the random kitten, then a funny message displays like "A section of glowing phosphor cells sings a song of radiation to you," "A sign reads: No robots allowed," or "There is no kitten! crackles the old crone. You are shocked by her blasphemy."If you do bump into the kitten, then a simple graphic plays with a big heart, and you win. Then you start again.That's it, it's super simple, just a cute, fun game.I really liked it, because it reminds me of all of the ASCII games of my yesteryear, but it's not super frustrating and hard like those games.Pros:-Only 268 KB-Entirely in ASCII characters-Very simple-Good for teaching kids and the elderly how to swipe on a touch screenCons:-Can't move to SD card-The characters are probably a little tiny for those with bad eyesight, which are probably who will like this game the most

Got my DROID phone last summer and have been using ToMarket Pro on my phone since then.  It's about as close of a replacement for HandyShopper you can find.  I use it on a daily basis to add things to my shopping list as I need them and my list is ready to go when it's time to go shopping.
A2KBY5BL7F0NBJ,B004FKK3FS,0.8,0.420390674899,0.0308677926616,0.000291205591147,0.585,0.971428571429,TRUTHFUL,This review is written from the perspective of a long-time Palm HandyShopper user, who switched to SplashShopper on the iPod Touch.There are numerous shopping apps for various platforms, all of which offer the basic "have a list, check off which items you need, check them off when you've bought them" functionality. Beyond that, the single feature that we used most in HandyShopper was the ability to associate a single item with multiple stores - and track aisles at each of those stores. As in, cereal is in aisle 5 at store A, aisle 3 at store B, and aisle 9 in store C. This gave us the ability to sort by aisle regardless of which nearby major store we happened to shop at.Until we found SplashShopper, we had zero luck finding any other tool that offered this capability. Unfortunately, while SplashShopper is a wonderfully full-featured tool, its iPod / iPhone implementation is notoriously slow - to the point of being unusable.With our new Android, we'd just about resigned ourselves to doing without the aisle functionality - when a chance search turned up ToMarket. SUCCESS!ToMarket also implements some of the same tools you'll find in other Android-based shopping list applications, such as voice input and barcode scanning.The good: Much faster than SplashShopper. Most of the same functionality. Very usable.The bad: Not easy to share lists among other users. You can email the list of "needs" to someone, and if you've filtered by a store and sorted by aisle, the emailed list is also sorted, filtered, and displays the aisle. So it's certainly usable for sharing, but other apps such as GroceryIQ and OurGroceries (which sync among multiple users automatically over the air) definitely have ToMarket beat there.For more comprehensive sharing, ToMarket works like SplashShopper (desktop sync, at an extra cost, then you have to import the entire database to the other user, and sync back), or HandyShopper, where you could beam the entire database via IR - again, overwriting the entire database. With ToMarket, you have to export/backup your entire list, get that export file to the other user, and import it onto the other handheld. You can do this via email or a service such as Dropbox, but it can be clumsy.My original review noted that "ToMarket also lacks the ability to store prices by store". I can't believe I haven't revisited that comment yet: you can indeed now store per-store prices for an item. I seem to recall I had to tweak a setting to enable it. I still don't use it often, but there are a few things I buy often enough, and at enough different stores, that it can be useful to be able to see what their prices are.Alternative input methods: Like many other recent apps (such as GroceryIQ and OurGroceries), ToMarket allows you to scan barcodes to add something to your list. This isn't something I use all that often - it's faster to just type the name. Plus, I don't usually record full brand names, just generic terms like "Elbow Macaroni" or "Tomatoes, Stewed".  You can also use voice input to add items and/or move things to the needed list.Like any other shopping list application, ToMarket can create multiple lists - e.g. "books to read", "things to pack for vacation" and the like.My bottom line: You have to decide which major feature is your own dealbreaker: ease of sharing / coordinating lists (anything but ToMarket), or single item / multiple stores (ToMarket is the only choice).

I was originally optimistic about this game, but once I played it a few times I realized that the only "goal" is to try and beat my own high score... over and over again. This may be perfect for some people, but I have become increasingly accustomed to games that offer a variety of different backgrounds and other rewards; I tend to be ambivalent about the rash of games that don't have these things, despite the capabilities to make them. I think one redeeming point here is the "hidden words" section -- but that's about it. By my third play, I was a bit tired of testing the limits of my vocabulary in the way this game wants me to.

It rejected the word BORN I made.  Hmmm... tried it again, verrry slowly just to make sure I clicked the letters correctly the first time.  And I see B O R N clear as day and click submit.  Then a big fat red NO! flashes AGAIN.  WHAT KIND OF DICTIONARY ARE THESE FOLKS USING FOR THIS APP?  Heck, its probably even a word in the default word list for EUROPE (SOWRD or something like that).  Makes you wonder how accurate the REST of the word database is!

The tiles you use get replaced and then you try to make another word. You can get bonuses and extra points depending on the point value of the letters used. You can even replace tiles if what you have in front of you isn't working.It is quick to get in to and play and only takes a few minutes per round. A perfect game for passing a little time. I thought this game was well made and very entertaining. A must for all word-game enthusiasts.

In the mean time I tried the free version of this game.The idea is similar to Scrabble in that you have a rack of tiles that you make words out of.  You can throw in tiles and get them replaced, etc.  That's where the similarity disappears.  You do not connect words, you just make words with what you have.It is a very fast paced game.  If you are a slow player, games will be very short.  You have to make words fast to keep the timer going, and even then, if you only make short words, the game time is very slow.  You have to make long words rapidly to keep going.Apparently some people can do this ad infinitum and have games that never end.  I don't know how to keep a life and get that good.  I feel the timers are far too fast for "normal" people.  I'm a pretty good Scrabble player, but it is hard to feel I have not hit a wall after only a few weeks of play.  When you feel you have hit a wall like that, it is hard to want to play.  That's what happened to me.I found you must read the manual to figure out some of what is going on.  My wife is also a good Scrabble player, but she has yet to come close to my "wall".  The things you have to do to keep the time from running out just do not work well for some Scrabble players.The idea behind lengthy game play and high scores is that you must never make mistakes, and you must make words more than three letters long.  Not making mistakes on a phone touchscreen keyboard is pretty hard... mistakes being as simple as accidentally trading in a letter because the X button is so stinking close to the letter you want to play that you sometimes hit it.  A word game should not make it necessary for you to have to have surgical precision when you use a touch screen - especially not when the app requires speed.  This is the game's Achille's heel if you ask me.  The user interface is poor considering what you have to do to excel at the game.  The user interface should help you, not hinder you.My tablet has a 4.3" screen.  I hated the game until I started playing with a stylus.  Even with the stylus the user interface issues are significant.  I cannot imagine playing this on a smaller screen.  The app runs only in portrait mode.  In some ways it seems good, but it is ironic that the vertical spacing is the primary issue with there not being enough space between the letter and the discard icon.  There is so much wasted space that this is totally unnecessary.I love the game but I cannot give it a 5 because the user interface and game design are immature.  The game does not help you want to keep playing it, or rather, does not facilitate it.  It is also a game that is great as long as you fit some kind of high-speed, precision profile, but if you are someone that enjoys word games to grow vocabulary, etc., this is not for you.  Speed and precision are paramount.  This almost seems to counter the ideas behind word games.There is an interesting back story so to speak.  The game has a built in list of hidden words.  If you happen to make that word, it uncovers it.  The idea is that it should help you want to keep playing and trying out more words.  It's a weird feature with promise.  The problem:  uncovering the hidden words is simply a matter of dumb luck.  Dumb luck and words games just don't mix if you ask me.There are also achievements that you can win.  Some of them have names that might be construed to be helpful in giving you an idea what you might have to do to get the achievement.  The problem is, most of them don't, so again, you have this bizarre goal that should make you want to play more, but there it is completely non-obvious what you have to do to gain the achievement.  Maybe it is buried in help?  I don't know, but you really should not _have_ to read the manual to get an idea how to enjoy a game like this.  The game should be able to lead you into good play habits, etc.If you play the free version, bear in mind all your efforts to load up the high score lists are in vain when you transition to the paid version.  Way to go.  Penalize the player for buying the app.  This is the typical feeling I get from this app.  The game goals that should encourage re-play and the implementation seem contradictory.  The implementation seems to be such that you have to have iron will to want to play more than a few times.  Games aren't something I generally want to have to have iron will about.  The game should make me want to play because it is so engaging.In the end, I still have the app on my tablet... but maybe not for long.  I am space constrained, so keeping good apps on there will come down to whether or not the game is something I want to play over and over.  I don't think this game has that now for the "average" or even for the "reasonably expert" word gamer.

However, as soon as you start to get into the game, it's over.If you like Professor Layton's on Nintendo DS then you would like this game. I guess it reminded me so much of Layton that I was expecting it to be longer.This is just a taste of an actual game, like maybe an inning of a baseball game. Not even an inning. Just one side up to bat.If this was longer, I'd give it 5/5. But I would expect to only devote an hour or less to play the whole game. Just as long as you realize that, you won't be disappointed.

Game play itself was cute, and the graphics were good, but otherwise not a great investment. Not only were some clues completely non-intuitive, but it took all of an hour to get through. That's it. I would have hoped it would take at least a few hours to justify the price, but no. And it's not as if I'm some skilled gamer who whips through games day in and day out. I'm very much a casual, infrequent game-player, yet this was mostly way too easy for me. You're not missing much, believe me.

Heck, I remember no computer at all and watching the original 13 Ghosts!  At $.99. it's a real bargain.  Like all good games, it leaves you wanting more.  Parts were more challenging for me because of my limited manual dexterity, but that's not the programmer's fault.  I like the game a lot and hope for other, similar products.

I don't know if I'm doing something wrong or if it just doesn't work well on the kindle fire. Any help from technical support or other users would be appreciated. Thanks. Price is good though.

Only complaint is that, yes, it's awfully short. About 3-5 hour playtime.And for some reason, muting the volume control only controls the title screen volume; in-game volume is unaffected.

It is a bit short, but it kept me entertained, and well worth buying before you get on a flight so that you can be occupied for a few hours.  I like it, just temper your expectations.  At this price, I don't think you expect 40 hours of entertainment with REAL content (not something that is repeated over and over again).

My nephew and I had a blast trying to figure out the clues. It had vey nice graphics and it was very challenging. The only thing I would change is, I wish it was longer.

When I got to the end I thought there would be more but it just ends. It took me about an hour to play. I wish it had a longer play time. It would have been great if the character found one of Grandpa's time travel devices and we had to travel through time to find and help him.

Great graphics and isn't impossible to play through. Sure it is short but how many rooms do you want to keep track of? We are playing on a mobile phone when we have a minute or two. Instead of a longer single game like some are saying I would recommend levels to progress to.  Droid 1st generation.

This game is a good click-and-discover / puzzle adventure game.The puzzles are challenging. The clues are well placed and thought provoking. The interface works well. Nice graphics.The only drawback (4 stars instead of 5) was the game was rather short.This game is fun, clever, and challenging. If you're looking for a puzzle adventure game that you can spend two or three hours playing, I highly recommend this game. I paid $0.99 at the time of this review and I think the game was worth it. I sat with my wife and son and we enjoyed  it together!

Best game app I've seen yet, except for the fact that it's so short.  If it were just one chapter in a much longer adventure, it would be perfect.

Like all point and clicks it suffers from repetition and the sense that all you are doing is going back and forth, room to room to re-click things now that you have the key and so on. Grisly also suffers from small screens and big fingers when it comes to finding stuff. On many screens you can just push everywhere until things pop up. Not much different than moving your mouse around the monitor till your arrow turns to a hand.Overall, Grisly is a fun diversion and a neat trip back in time to old school games. It is easily one of the better looking and functioning games I've played so far. Fans of the genre should pick this one up. If you don't like point and click, don't mark the game down, just don't get it.Worth the cost.

Only two real &quot;puzzles,&quot; everything else is find the key, unlock a door, find a doodad, use it to get another key.  And of those puzzles, I only solved one, and did the other through trial and error.  Also, the ending is terrible.  Not a good use of your time.

I am revising my review from 1 star to 4.The game is a point-and-click style adventure in the vein of Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis or Maniac Mansion.  You explore the manor, picking up assorted objects and clues to solve various puzzles.  These puzzles can open new rooms or provide pieces to still other puzzles.The game took me about 1 hour to finish, though this sort of game is old-hat for me.  Some of the puzzles were quite difficult, particularly figuring out the proper color sequence (if you play the game, you'll know what I mean).  Unfortunately, the game doesn't appear to have much replayability, since the puzzles are always the same.Is the game worth $1.99?  I'm not sure.  I got an hour's worth of brain-wracking enjoyment out of it.  That's slightly more per hour than a DVD rental, but cheaper than theatre or movie tickets.Old review:1 starForce closes immediately on my Motorola Xoom. And from reading other reviews, it appears the Xoom isn't the only device having this issue. Glad it was free.

Decently long, but not quite as long as a similar full PC game.Some things that I felt were not well designed (but may have fit in with the vision of "just click everything!" -*There is a corridor on the second floor between the other doors- you have to click in the middle of the wall, and find there is another door.*They used four birds, and four colors on the globe, but needing to be arranged in a direction, corresponding to the drawing on the second floor. Confusing since the colors on the globe seem to have the same directions of the drawing, and not the "statues"* in the main hallway both the floor and the "paper" on the painting aren't visibly "interactive".Overall a fun game, and most of the puzzles are fun to figure out. Graphics are great, the only real complaints are the issues with the game design, and possibly wanting more to the story - but it is after all a puzzle game, and not needing a "cool story".

However I love the nostalgia of playing mystery/puzzle point and click games. This particular game had pretty simple puzzles. However I would LOVE to see more games of this genre. Preferably targeting a more mature audience with perhaps more elaborate puzzles. Great start, dev. Thanks also to Amazon appstore for the freebie.

Pretty fun, but only took me a few hours to solve, even getting stuck. If you like clue - driven solve the problem games, you should get it! If not, then probably still with a try, I liked it.

Yeah, yeah, I know, it's only a $1.  But, if I spent $1 on every game/app that I thought I'd spend more than a few minutes with...Anyhow, I am happy to say I'm very pleased with it.  The graphics, background music, and sound effects all blend well together into a spooky feel.  Controls are easy to work with and respond well.  Gameplay is similar to the old Myst titles, where you wander around solving puzzles and finding clues.  Performance on my Epic was perfect, not a single hitch with it.  Hope to see more games like this one!Hopefully this review was helpful for you.  If not, feel free to leave comments/questions.

This is the first similar game I've tried on an Android device (Droid 2).  Considering the screen size and memory limitations the developer has to work with, I consider this very well done.  If you don't enjoy this type of puzzle/hunt adventure game, this isn't for you...but if you do like this type of game, give it a try... you will be pleased.People who are so critical of these apps, consider what you're getting for free or a dollar or two... what do you expect?  These apps are bargains for the entertainment they provide.

Its a bit quirky and the storyline is a bit obtuse which leaves one with a very loose idea of where to look next in some areas.  In games like this the fun is all in the delivery, the story unfolding.  Unfortunately thats where this one falls short... and speaking of short.. if the delivery were better and the clues/solutions a bit more logical this game would take all of about 10 minutes to play though.  I wish I could give this a 5 star rating but even though it is entertaining and has a good atmosphere it just leaves you wishing for more. But the creators have my sincere appreciation and applause. I wish more gaming companies would work to supply the fans of this genre with hours and hours of entertaining deduction.

Although graphics quality is excellent, this is really, REALLY too short.  It took me maybe an hour to complete it. Also the last puzzle was really finicky (blue circles on basement door) and the lightest touch will cause it to reset so that even if you've solved it once, you're forced to do so again (and again). Also, the ending was lame - a real anticlimax.It was also pretty easy, but I don't mind this if there are a lot of visually interesting scenes or landscapes.

(It wasn't too short, but I wouldn't of been dissapointed if it had been longer.) I read the reviews for The secret of Grisly manor, and seeing it was made by the same people as The lost city, I bought it for $0.99. I had read reviews, and some people said it was very short, and I figured it would be as long as the other one (Which took me about a week). I was very wrong..I could've finished it in half an hour.So I gave The secret of Grisly Manor 4 stars, because I was dissapointed in the length. (In my opinion. it should be free - it wasn't long enough to be worth even a dollar.)If you're going to purchase one, purchase The lost city - you won't be dissapointed!

I really enjoyed finding the hidden clues and solving the puzzles. Just enough of an eerie feeling to make it interesting, but not scary at all. What I really like about this game is that I don't have to sit and play it for hours. I was satisfied playing it in 10 minute increments in between doing other things. If I had played it non-stop it probably would have taken an hour or so to complete. I do like that it didn't drag on forever, although I would have liked another level or something. The ending was underwhelming, but the journey was enjoyable enough to convince me to buy The Lost City, the latest game from this developer. I hope they make more of these types of games. Even though they're short, they're well-worth the low price, so much went into making them look beautiful, sound moody, and play without hiccups.

The puzzles and item usage is pretty standard for a game like this.I wouldn't say that the game is too short like some of the other reviews here, but I would say that once you've beaten it the first time, there's no point in replaying it because there aren't any puzzles that will take you long to beat again or any game mechanics you'll forget and have fun relearning.

I love the mystery games with the puzzle elements, and these puzzles don't disappoint! They're challenging enough that you'll scratch your head for a bit, but won't be too difficult for the sake of being difficult.My main problem with this is that its too expensive. Almost 2 dollars for a game that you can beat in less than an hour? I've spent 4 dollars on other apps that have a gameplay of 20+ hours and its still going. Wish it was longer, or at least that they would make a free version with advertisement throughout the game.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, YOU WILL REGRET IT. sounds more fun than it really is.

I'm not very good at these types of games, mainly because I don't have much experience with them, but that hasn't stopped me from continuing to explore the mansion as best I can.I like the graphics and the music.  The challenges are interesting and for me a bit challenging, but again it may just be my experience that's holding me back.Overall, I like it quite a bit.

Only a few times did I get frustrated - it does a good job of balancing the difficulty.  Five stars because I let my five year old daughter play.  With a little help from me she absolutely loved it.

The big problem with some of the apps on the Amazon app store is the inability for it to  distinguish properly if it will run properly on each device...

I rated it four stars because it is fun, and was worth a dollar. Hope they make more games like this (or port over myst for the fire)

Had force close problems when starting it up a couple times but otherwise ran fine on my Epic.  Agree that the ending is lame.  don't really see the need for app to SDCard as it's the type of game you'll only play once through then uninstall.

The fact that it was short, played in less than two hours with a granddaughter, by candlelight and flashlight (power outage)  and the ending was a 'cop-out&#34;, caused me to be disappointed.However, I am sure that children and preteens will enjoy it, so based on age I think it will work fine for some.  Being a 79 year oldGreat Granny (who has played mysteries with grandchildren) might not make me the right person to review this adequately, for those of younger ages.  I guess what I am saying, is the challenge is there for the much younger generations, though not necessarily for teenagers.

There weren't any false leads that sent me scurrying off in the wrong direction. The end was rather abrupt , unexpected, and somewhat of a let down, however, that is minor compared to the massive amount of sheer fun it was to play. Maybe it was short, but it left me wanting more.

I see a lot of complaints about it being too short and it is a bit quickly played only if you're familiar with this type of game. Besides the game is only  49&cent;. I just wish it was longer because it was so fun. I did need online help with some of it. For players new to this type of game, ignore nothing and tap on every inch of the screen because if you don't you will feel like a complete idiot when you get help and realize the answers are staring you in the face. I know I did.

This is great as a free application and great as a little puzzler to pass the time.  However, there is no story line or ending to speak of.  I think this a great example of a true graphic rich, fits in your pocket, point and click &quot;mystery&quot; type game.  To short and not deep enough but this developer is on to something! Keep these type of games coming!

What was the point of figuring out those little puzzles if it is going to end so abruptly and accomplish nothing?

Not worth the money...even though I downloaded this on a free day.

I did have to think about some of the challenges, but it would also be appropriate for an older child.  However, the game was so short it almost seemed more like a demo than a full game. I would've been very disappointed if I'd paid for the app instead of getting it when Amazon featured it for free.  If it was expanded, I'd happily increase my rating.

If you follow the clues, read the signs and use a little creative ideas, you can solve this without going insane. Some items you use more than once... (that should help last little). I would recommend this game without hesitation.

Takes a couple hours to complete unless you are a super genius. Graphics and puzzles are all first-rate.I've seen people complaining about the game being too short. For 99 cents? With this kind of game the developers can't automatically generate infinite puzzles. The game ending suggests sequels - can't wait.Played on my Droid X with no technical problems.

The movement is a little clunky and some of few locations are only used once. The look was ok, nothing froze or went wrong on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9" The reason for the 3 stars, which is in itself abstract, is that there is no help. If you get stuck, you're on your own OR you have to resort to the internet walkthrough. Not fun for me. Even with the help online, I quickly realized that I would never have figured some of the puzzles, clues and their use or finished this game. For me, maybe it's more like a 1-star, but I know this game has a cult following of obviously clever folks who are able to solve the clues and I want to encourage all game makers to give us Kindle people MORE!

The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of five is because it is so short. It downloaded to my Kindle fire without any trouble.  This game has wonderful graphics, a very engaging puzzle, and kept my interest very well.  It was a good game and I hated to see it end.  I hope to see more from this company.

Unlike The Lost City, this game does not have the hint and map features, so it's up to you to figure out the clues and locate the puzzle pieces.  That being said, I finished the game in a few hours and wished there was more to it.  I agree that it could have been longer with more screens. Again, the graphics were nicely done, the puzzles fairly easy to solve, and it worked well on my Kindle Fire.This had a nice balance between clever and challenging clues.I probably would have been less disappointed if I had played this game first and followed it with The Lost City.

I must say, this is defiantly fun in every possible term of a Mystery/Search and Find game app. There are a bunch of mini-puzzles that are good brain challengers, but are still quite fun. Erie music really adds to the feeling of mystery as you search Grandpa's house and his estate for clues as to his whereabouts. Great graphics, even for a game that doesn't have too much visual movement. Overall, the game itself is quite fun and enjoyable. There are just two things that aren't too pleasing: first thing is that it doesn't give any hints or anything like that to help you pass the puzzles and find some objects. Sure, most people will want to solve the mystery on there own, but on some of those really hard puzzles, there's no way to get a hint in any form anywhere. Other games similar to this one give small hints to those who need them, but not this game. Really wish this is something that they could add. And second, the game itself is a little too short. If your stuck on a puzzle for like, two months, that really isn't any short amount of time to pass a game like this. But in general, this game is kind of short. And I'm pretty sure that they could have made it longer easily.Besides these things, this is still a very fun app with a mystery that I'm sure you'll have allot of fun solving. Any problems that you'll find in this app will be small and won't hinder your game play in any great way. I'm pretty sure that you'll enjoy it when you get it.

It's short, but ABSOLUTELY a value for $1. Right now I am going to go looking for more games in this genre and by this publisher.If I were an adult looking for a challenging game to play on my own, I would want something more than this. But...* As a game to play with your kid, this is great!* For a $1 diversion, this is great!

To be fair, a point-and-click adventure game featuring puzzles around a an abandoned mansion is hardly a new idea, but it felt like plagiarism.Regardless, the Secret of Grisly Manor holds up ok on its own.Pros: Challenging puzzles, point-and-click gameplay, decent atmosphereCons: way too short (about 1/2 hour), poorly detailed graphics (looks like very old compression), a couple of seemingly arbitrary puzzles/solutionsConclusion: I pray that we are seeing a revival of point-and-click adventure games for tablets. Buy this game if you have 49 cents to spare, enjoy classic adventure games, and have already played the Mystery of Crimson Manor.

The game itself is very short which I would have been fine with for a dollar but add that to the fact that there was no hint button and no instructions to any of the games and the clues where very  obscure and where not at all clear which puzzle they went to, and then the ending was just weird.  Anyway I don't recommend this game at all.

I guess I just didn't have the patience to actually figure it out on my own. This was one of the first games I got in this genre, and I really enjoyed it. It was over pretty quickly. Felt like it could have had a bit more added to it, because felt short. I didn't feel ripped off or anything, just wished it had been longer. Fire Maple does a good job! Since finishing this game I have bought other games they have come out with and enjoyed them even more! Just buy it already, it's good.

Graphics were great, no glitches on the Fire and it's not overly challenging. It's too short though. I think it took about an hour to finish, but for 99 cents I had fun.

I've had sneezes take longer than this game. You find a few things, put them together and before your Kindle warms up you are done. No puzzles, no mini games, no story. VERY boring. Don't waste your time or money. Take the 99 cents, put a penny with it and get a hamburger from MCd's. At least you have something to show for your money.

I wish I would have read the reviews more thoroughly, I would have avoided wasting my money! There is no hint or help,to get you through the game,makes no sense.

Some of the puzzles were simple but fun. Although this isn't my favorite kind of game, it's still a bit nostalgic and refreshing to play the classic puzzle/adventure style game. They did a decent job with it.Cons:Story wasn't all that impressive, and usually that's what really sells this genre of game(i.e. it's no 7th guest). Game is pretty short as well. And with most games like this, i generally throw away strategy and logic and just start clicking places until something new happens, thus ruining the game for myself lol. Not the games fault, just not 'my thing'. 3 stars is purely based on game though.. and a slight lack of compelling story elements and being short made what could of been a decent game, just ok.Should you buy? Worth grabbing today to play through. I wouldn't personally drop a dollar on this, i like a little more action than a game of this caliber is willing to provide, and the puzzles here are nothing to brag about. But for the people who love this adventure/puzzle style game, it's worth a play through.

The one place I got stuck - throw the pretty box in the fire! The graphics are beautiful, the play is smooth. The sound is not as good as the sound on The Lost City, but not bad. Really, this would get 5 stars if only it was longer. I'd prefer something like Myst; something to take days/weeks to complete, rather than a couple of hours.

I beat it from start to finish in an hour and a half without any help. But it really was like playing Myst on my phone. The interface is perfect too and the controls are easy - that's why I hope they make more games like this, only longer. If they make a game that takes 10+ hours to beat it'd be worthy of 6 stars.

However, Grisly Manor seems more like a prototype rather than a fully formed game and features present in the subsequent games are sorely missed here.  The Journal is particular, which saves a great deal of time retracing the path back to previously-explored rooms to review clues to puzzles.  On the other hand, perhaps that was deliberate in order to artificially inflate the amount of time it takes to solve the game.  Because as short as Mosaika and Lost City are, Grisly is practically a blip.  The puzzle solutions in Grisly weren't as involved either, which is troubling as the other games are not exactly complex.  The Secret of Grisly Manor has atmosphere in its graphics and sound, but as a puzzle game, while acceptable, it doesn't compare to the rest of Fire Maple Games' offerings, even at 99 cents.

Its fairly short (about under an hour long), not too difficult either.  I personally enjoyed it while it lasted.For everyone that says it Forces Closes, the same happened to me on my Epic 4G.  All I had to do, was simply slide my keyboard open and start the game and voila!  When I close the keyboard at any time, it FC's though. (If you dont have a slide-out keyboard, maybe you can force your phone to display in landscape prior to running it)I hope that helps any FC errors and allows everyone to enjoy this game :-)

No annoying hidden objects. All the clues are reasonable and discoverable, and you have hints available too. I only wish the game were a bit longer. This is also a good introduction to this kind of game for newbies or younger players, at least in part because you will be able to finish it and not have to go through fifteen scenes to get back to where you need. I wish Fire Maple would make more games like this!

The puzzles are a good level of difficulty; not too terribly easy, nor head-bangingly frustrating. The atmosphere is a light-hearted brand of creepy which manages to be enigmatic without being sinister, thus preserving it's spoken of family orientation.

For $1 it's a pretty decent investment for those looking for a way to kill 30 to 60 minutes - or more if you want to drag it out. The problem I had was I found out the solution in 2 nights of playing for about 10 minutes total. Great play, good price, would also love to see a sequel - or maybe a longer version of the same?

Grisly Manor is okay and will keep one occupied for an hour, but it's no more than that. It's not in the same league as The Room.

For a feeebie? 5stars... as a paid app? Meh.. 3 stars. If the author keeps adding to the story line, then it'd become more towards 5,rather than 3. Last puzzle was a bit annoying due to some alignment issues. (If you make it to the end, you'll see what I'm talking about.)

But it is worth it since there are so few adventure games for the android. If you like the old school adventures like 7th guest then go for it. Droid 2.

It's something like a mystery game where you look for clues and solve little puzzles. Not too hard not too obvious either.  Would be a good game to play by yourself or your kid (I recommend it for 10+). As many others noted, the game is short and it's over in less than an hour.  I still recommend this game.

If you're going to make a paid app, be sure it works first, and make it long enough to be worth the money.

I had an issue with force closes one time, but it went away and no problems since. Fun while it lasted, you're basically paying a dollar for a little over 30 minutes of entertainment.

The puzzles were a little easy, but that prob is because it seems targeted at younger players.  I say that because of the story line.  Would be nice if there was a update to lengthen the game, and maybe add a few difficulty levels.  But since I got it for free (love amazon app store), I will not complain.
A1FYUP9I8L9PGD,B004FOA84A,1.6116838488,0.64,0.0,0.0,0.026,0,TRUTHFUL,took five tries to open. finally start to get into  it and now wont open again. liked what i saw. gotta fix force close issue.

Only bad thing is that I finished the game in like 4 hours. I have played The Haunt which is excellent. Very similar to this game but a little harder and longer took me about 2 weeks to complete.

You owners of weak phones... GET BETTER PHONES!  Game is boring and too short. Glad I got it for free or I'd been mad if I paid for this product. Good try devs but meh from my POV. Sorry. Oh, and look... Damazon brought the word count down to 20. Smh. One word for this game... NO.

I spent time playing it when I should have been doing something more constructive, but it held my attention and most of the puzzles weren't TOO easy. Well, for the most part anyway. It was way to short though. A couple of hours and done.

I plan to write this review, then I'm going to purchase both games by Fire Maple Games. I don't care how short this game is, it sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun. There is only one review on the other game, but if it's anything like this  one sounds, it's going to be a blast too. I'll be back to leave another review on how much I like them. I don't mind paying .99 cents for this game (no matter how short) then paying another $1.99 for the other game. They both sound like a lot of fun (my kind of fun). When I'm done I know my grandson will love them as well, so in my mind, it's well woth the money. Well I'm gone now to buy my games, and have some fun. I'll be back in a day or so to let you know just how much fun they are. Thank you Fire Maple Games.

I would love to see this dev release another game like this as they did such a good job with this one. Check out the Lost City by the same dev. It's another game just as equally awesome as this one.

A1L04Z204ITLSO,B004FOA84A,2.6116838488,0.627380952381,0.0252100840336,0.0,0.049,0,TRUTHFUL,So I was pretty stoked about playing this game, since it's genre is right up my alley. Unfortunately it keeps force closing on me, so I am unable to play it. Luckily I didn't pay for it, because that would have been a total waste of $0.99
A178VWQH7MMOBG,B004FOA84A,0.388316151203,0.56626984127,0.0218579234973,0.0,0.036,1.0,TRUTHFUL,Just installed on xoom and it's running fine, not sure what the other reviewer's problem is. I played a little and it seems interesting,  kind of like the PC games from the early 90s.

They say that any Android is a good Android, but they say a lot of things. Much like anything else, if you buy something cheap, it will work like something cheap. Also, people need to learn their phones. no matter what anyone tells you, they don't REALLY think for you. Anyway, this works great on the Samsung Fascinate, and even if it didn't, I'm not the type to complain about something free. People today.....I swear. LOL

Graphics are great, puzzles are difficult but not impossible, the story (however minimal it is) was good. The only reason for the 4 stars is how short the game was.
A3VKTVNURQ0IIQ,B004FOA84A,1.3883161512,0.456481481481,0.0308641975309,0.0,0.032,0,TRUTHFUL,Great game, hope to see more in the future. This is the first game like this that I've found for android. It was a reasonable length but I definitely wanted more.

Did have a few FCs on my Droid Incredible, but simply relaunching worked fine. A couple of times I was stumped pretty good and had to give it a bit of thought but for the most part it was pretty straightforward and I finished in an afternoon. I hope there's more to come, more complex and longer to play. :)

It should be longer, possibly extending from the storyline where our leaves off about the grandpa wanting to show him so much. Great game and graphics, just too short.
A2AAFNO64628HA,B004FOA84A,1.3883161512,0.35,0.05,0.0,0.065,0,TRUTHFUL,This game was on the display of a Kindle Fire in our local Staples. Every time I went in the store, I had to play it. This game is what led me to own the Kindle Fire. Since owning the Kindle Fire, I have found it to be a useful tool, as well. Very portable if you don't want to carry a laptop around.

So to test it out, I entered 2.2 pounds (generally accepted as 1 kilogram) and the calculator came up with .998 kilograms. That makes this app of no use to me.

Pro is basically the same except with every imaginable category and unit, including things like shoe size and data (and yes, temperature!). If you're thinking of upgrading it's a no brainer for $0.99.

Working in a restaurant, being able to convert quarts in to tablespoons and teaspoons quickly is quite useful.  Its also interesting to play around with all the other measurements.

I work in a Nuclear Lab in the US and the first thing I wanted to do is convert millirem (mrem) to either microsievert (Sv) or millisievert (mSv). No go! Sievert is a common European radiation measurement. Works great for many others things and says it will convert radiation exposure measurements BUT I am still stuck looking it up on the web.Up date:After checking the web site for this app I see it does Radioactive Decay NOT Radioactive exposure like I thought...my bad. I raised to 4 stars (not 5) because for me Radioactive exposure is much more important then decay. Maybe it will be added??Up date:I sent e-mail to the developer with my suggestion and got a very positive reply right away. Very nice! I now believe this is a 5 stare app.

It doesn't  seem to have a limit as far as I can see. A very handy travel accessory.Anyone having to deal with different measurements should find this app most useful.

I guess I would have liked a little explanation of what it all meant, but after a while I was able to use it a little.  I'm sure that many people had no trouble at all, but then I'm not the most clever when it comes to these things.  If I were, I wouldn't need a &#34;Convertor Pro&#34;, would I?  I will spend more time and rise to the challenge & in the end, I shall conquer!

I thought it was meant to make calculating things easy but either I'm incredibly thick - hence downloading the App to make my life easier - or the App is great and I'm just not "getting it" but either way it's going in the recycle bin. Sorry Devs I need an idiot proof version or more detailed instructions on how to use it.

This is one of those tools that gathers dust until you really need it. It's a must for people that work in a technical environment and needs to from time to time make a conversion that is not in the norm of daily work.

Woo hoo...Since becoming an Android user I've been tolerant of "good enough" music synchronization capabilities offered by other applications (including the upgrade/pro version ofWinampand doubleTwist. One (Winamp) was good enough, while doubleTwist had serious issues that led me to uninstall and look for other solutions.The turn to Amazon MP3 came when Amazon added its "AutoRip" service to user accounts. In short: if you were already using Amazon's cloud player (I was), they added the tracks from any CDs purchased from Amazon (since 1998) to your cloud player list. Since I had already made an "Amazon over iTunes store" decsion earlier, this became an ideal solution for me. Essentially, all music I've ever purchased from Amazon is available in cloud streaming and .mp3 formats (and presumably I still have the physical media from CD purchases, which are not so frequent in my house these days).As for the player itself: it quickly indexed the .mp3 contents of my phone and flawlessly accesses my cloud content (network connections permitting). It automatically switches between Bluetooth and headphones, depending on the what I'm playing the music to. The interface is uncluttered and intuitive. Once you've made the decision to turn control of your music inventory over to Amazon...the rest is easy!

I have a smart phone without a data plan, so I have music saved to the memory on my phone; accessible when I am not in wifi range.  It worked wonderfully as my &#34;ipod&#34; until Prime Music launched.  My phone updated the app, and a massive amount of music was suddenly available for my listening pleasure.  Great in concept!  But, the new version of the app has made playing songs from my device a miserable experience.  Where it worked flawlessly a few days ago, it now takes MINUTES for a song to play.  I give up on it working, put it back in my pocket, and a few minutes later hear the song take off.  Skipping ahead?  Nope.  Pausing?  Yeah, that works well still.  Why does the new version affect songs that are stored to my device?  I don't understand it.

Go to Itunes for this, Amazon for that, who knows whoever is going to come with the next new service.  Same for video, Warner Brothers apparently pulling videos from Netflix, to form their own service.If they're going to &#34;DRM&#34; things, then there should be the equivalent of a DRM clearing house.  If I &#34;buy&#34; an album, then that album should be able to check in and let me listen to the thing irrespective of what I'm using online to listen to it.  (Idealistic, but then hey, why not wish for the moon?).Plus, until recently I only had a 3G phone with limited data plans, so what was the point.And of course speakers on phones suck.So, Music?I do Pandora and several other streaming services, but see no need for yet another &#34;source&#34; of music.I have bought music through Amazon's MP3 Service.  And other than the poorly documented, confusing interface (downloading), it worked okay.  But even then, nothing that I would stream directly via an app.I really like having it simple, all music coming from pretty much one place.So so so....If you use it, more power to you.

Frankly I had this app frozen on my rooted Droid 2 until Amazon came out with Cloud Player. Now I have a ton of music online and use this player almost exclusively.The main complaint I have is that the Player doesnt remember where I was the last time I ran it. This is a big issue when trying to listen to audio books. Everytime I close the program for a second (hit the home key or switch tasks) I have to remember where I was in the current track. And then when I reopen I (many times) have to scroll to find my album, the tack then click cose to where I was. It is just too hard. Save the last location and I give this a 5 star.UPDATE: When Amazon enacted their limits to songs/ storage or purchase this year I deleted it. Storage is so very cheap now (especially for Amazon, who doesn't have to actually store each song, but only a marker saying we have access to the song) and there are so many competitors (Google Play Music, for instance) I can't justify using this app. I downloaded all my songs (which took almost a day!) then deleted. You've lost me, Amazon MP3, until you give back unlimited storage.

It's a shame Amazon can't get this more stable as my family only purchases music from Amazon and it'd be nice if streaming music was a lot more reliable.  As it stands I just download all the MP3s we buy and put them on my SD card.

I can download music I've purchased from Amazon or songs I've uploaded (like the songs I imported from my old iTunes.

You can sort by artist or album or song or genre, and you can make playlists too.

I'd give 5 stars on the s2.I upgraded to an S5 recently. It has some features that need improved on the s5. I can find music in the store. But, I cannot in the cloud or on my device which makes it cumbersome. The S5 lacks the search button. I used on the s2. With my increased storage on the s5. I'd like to download all my cloud music. It would be nice to be able to see what is out of sync and download it like the desktop offers. I'll probably use windows and my sd card to sync the music because the player is cumbersome.I've started using the android player. It has the search function that isn't in the amazon app. It needs some improvement.

The cloud player service makes this the best thing to happen to music in a long. Now you can upload all your music to there website and have access to all your music without taking up space on your devices anymore. Also great if you like me always have to transfer song from multiple devices now you can just upload or buy from amazon have access to everything instantly from any device that can use the service. Android phone/tablet pc or MAC computer. So you get to keep your music forever unlike itunes one time purchase and goodlook with keep your music safe. See even if you music device fails you instantly have all your music back.Thanks for making something we always needed.

I get &#34;exception 119&#34; or other playback errors.  This is annoying in and of itself, but when using the player during a run or workout, it completely stops the player, meaning I have to finish the run/workout without music, or break my pace/concentration to skip to the next song.Getting a paltry number of &#34;free&#34; (for prime) songs to choose from doesn't override the inconvenience of a player that doesn't play.....

I use this app every night to play my "Brown Noise" for sleeping and generally whenever I want to listen music through my phone.Using the app is straight forward, with a simple layout and standard player controls. You can select to display the music in the Cloud, previously downloaded to the device, or access the Amazon "Store". The app also allows downloading your Cloud stored MP3 files to your device but, as other reviewers have noted, it does not allow you to select where they are stored (i.e. to your SD card). The download location shortcoming is not a significant issue for me since I don't have a lot of music files, but this would be an issue for someone like my daughter who has hundreds of files.The ease of use and access to the Cloud stored files makes this a good choice for my needs.Recommended!CFH

Now it's totally lost it. And because I unknowingly installed the latest update, I now have Amazon Music. My main complaint is that it only works in portrait. I have a Sony Tablet S. For my tablet I have both a charging stand and a different stand that I use at work - both landscape. I have to keep turning it to portrait to see the lists and controls and menus. Am I mistaken that tablets are poplar now? This set up for a phone. Plus I keep getting code number errors and have to restart my tablet. I've emailed Amazon 3 times and had to reinstall  yesterday. What a pain. I definitely don't want Prime Music and it is always on there asking if I do or if I want to  purchase with that or regular. It switches menus when I try to listen to more than one song on an album, taking time for the switch that I could have been listening to the sample tracks. Plus, I do not want people on Facebook knowing what I'm listening to. Who cares? And that's an invasion of my privacy. Can you tell that I don't like this and I'm very unhappy with it? I'm starting to like Walkman and Songza more and more.

The functionality is straightforward and easy to use on the noted tablet. The app is totally messed up on the S3 phone. The only way to get music to play on the smartphone is in &#34;airplane&#34; mode. Otherwise the albums that were supposed to be downloaded didn't show up. On the phone, and trying to get to music via the cloud, Amazon blocks you from access to your music with a splash screen that holds you hostage from accessing music you've already paid for unless you agree to try Amazon Prime for 30 days. Advice:  Boycott until they stop that and fix the app.

I buy all of my tunes from Amazon, the prices are usually fair, there's no DRM telling me what I can and cannot play it on or how many times I can listen to it before it disappears (iTunes and Wally World, for instance). I've also noticed that I can buy explicit (uncensored) music at Amazon, I absolutely HATE listening to a tune where they've chopped and butchered it to make it &#34;clean&#34;!!! Not much &#34;storage&#34; space for things purchased in the past, so I store it on Google...

I still spend time clicking the same song 10 times while shopping trying to review it only to have the song 5 tracks down start playing. As a loyal customer to Amazon I do want them to have great apps to support the music I buy from them. However this app in the past few months has cut my music shopping/exploring time in half. Simply put, this app is not up to Amazon standards IMO.

Just another Prime &#34;benefit&#34; that is totally unusable because, once again, Amazon hired The Three Stooges to develop the app that runs it.  Nyuck THAT.Amazon - If you want families to begin flocking to your Prime club, make the benefits available to ALL ITS MEMBERS and for ALL DEVICES, or they feel cheated for the price they're paying you for Prime, especially after the INCREASE. Got an email today saying this music service is now available for Prime members, so get ready for the big disappointment when the Prime members realize it's just another component that is seriously lacking and not adding to the reasons why one should subscribe.

With the old version my music loaded fast and continued playing when I did other things on my phone. Now the music loads slowly and stops when I'm doing other things.

It is easy to make a playlist, find a song, play a song, buy a song, or whatever else you usually need to do with .mp3's.  I love it!I also love how it ties into the cloud services and allows me to download my .mp3 purchases with a few taps on the screen.Somebody had complained that you couldn't make a playlist with song both on your local device and from the cloud.  While this is true, you can easily download the songs onto your device and then add them to your playlist.  Easy peasy!The only thing I wish I could do is to bookmark songs within a playlist.  I would love it if they would add it as it would be really easy.  I like to listen to both .mp3 music files and audiobook files and having a bookmark feature would allow me to switch between music and the spoken word without loosing my place inside of a book.  Amazon: PLEASE ADD!!  I have purchased (yes, I paid money) another book reader, Ambling BookPlayer, for this feature alone. I would love to have it all in one central location.Otherwise, this is great especially with it being tied into the Amazon Cloud storage services.  Just awesome!

To my surprise, after I got the Amazon MP3 app, I was able to easily get my Amazon Cloud on my device and therefore listen to all of the music that I had already downloaded for another device.  It's easy to use and if you like music, Amazon is one of the best sources to find just about any MP3 you want.

Now that Amazon has their Cloud service in full swing, this app suddenly has a lot of potential. So far music streaming works great on WiFi and 3G. I would like to see an onboard equalizer though. Aside from that it works as advertised and I look forward to seeing how far they can take their new Cloud ecosystem.

With the MP3 app being integrated with the Amazon Cloud, it's now easy to purchase or play my music from my Android phone and tablet.

Cloud service is cool. I really don't have to worry about hogging up the memory on the device and I still have an unlimited data plan and plan to keep until I am forced over to capped plan :)Now the bad. Performance wise it just sucks. No nice way to put it. I was searching for a song through the app, force closes =/. Attempted to play the song through via cloud, times out and either prompts for a force close or ask to wait. Seems to be hit or miss right now. Maybe its carrier performance or maybe its app, but if i can stream video via Netflix or Crackle, i tend to point to a performance issue with the app. I truly understand the difficulties of having to make the app compatible with the different devices. Like a computer, you can run windows, but depending on hardware you may not be able to run something someone else can. That said, I hope they address the performance issue in the near future. Oh I am using the Motorola Atrix.

I never got past the permissions screen- could not believe how intrusive they have made this app!  So I didn't accept the terms, went back and read the reviews.  There were enough bad reviews to give me serious pause, and after realizing the app would only store to phone internal memory (not the memory card), as well as the syncing issues, I have decided to give this app a pass and use the native music player preloaded on my phone.  Sorry Amazon- I will miss being able to download music directly to my phone from Amazon purchases- but not enough to use your app.

I actually use another app for playing the majority of my music on my phone, so the ability to download the music is great!

It offers the option to download and automatically add to iTunes.

Purchasing, downloading (and re-downloading, if you need to) are all simple. Playback is fairly simple, too.What will make this the best (it's not there yet; I am aware of the limitations):- adjustable bit rate streaming- enhanced flexibility in the player (playlists, tag editing, etc.)- purchase streaming-only version for a fraction of the cost (enable upgrade later)- mark previous purchases as purchased, and inaccessible for re-purchaseKeep up the great work!

The app will launch momentarily and then force close. Following this my tablet will be sluggish until I reboot it. Through process of trial and error I stopped all apps and narrowed it down to when this particular app runs, it causes an issue. I've attempted fresh installs and clearing the cache but none of this has been successful. Even reading somewhere that the app was not compatible with equalizers, which I would hope has at least been accommodated by this point; disabling the equalizer features has been unsuccessful. After these problems and no fix, I just uninstalled it.

It has a setting called &quot;refresh cloud library&quot; that runs EVERY 10 min whether you want it or not.

(!!!)My phone has 8GB- will spare you the math, but it's an obvious flaw that has yet to be corrected.Apparently this app is designed for people who just sit and listen to music- perhaps people reading on their Kindles.Great if you're sedentary - not so much so for other demographics.The default LG Music app is actually more user-friendly/easier to use under mobile conditions.(This tells you how bad the Amazon Music with Prime Music app is).Just found out this morning that it deleted all playlists on my device with the upgrade.OH....SOoooo not happy about that.I thought they were on the SD card- my bad; yeah, I (now know that I) should have backed them up.I spent a lot of time in hospital waiting rooms generating those playlists (not at leisure at home at a PC where I could create, port, etc.).Am not happy about this.I see no reason to use my mobile bandwidth to listen to Amazon Prime.(I don't sit in coffee shops/school environs with free WiFi).When I'm on a road trip- it's my bandwidth that's used if so.I have a huge SD card with tons of songs, and I don't need to use bandwidth to listen.Prime Music offers me nothing in this situation.If I'm at home, fine.But it simply doesn't serve a new function for me- I have already Spotify / Pandora if I want ambient sound at home, with selections, playlists, etc. already set up.What do I gain here by using this app?Whatever I do gain- it's incremental/likely not worth the additional effort.Amazon's late to the game on this.Will simply be buying less from Amazon Music because I won't be using their app (won't be running across products to buy).

It took up too much room in my devices and is unique to it's own products. I am a freedom loving person and the Cloud player let's me be free. I can buy from many sources and the best part is it doesn't eat up any space on my electronics. The sound quality is superb. Ease of use excellent. When I had a problem today I talked to a specialist in 3 minutes. He took me thru a little tutorial and now I know a lot more than I did before. The streaming has been uninterrupted.It is an easier, friendlier option to the other one and I am very happy to let Amazon store my music until I want to hear it. I have nothing bad to say about it. If you are new to Mp3 music streaming, I recommend, without hesitation, that you start here. II have read the bad reviews and I am sorry to hear people have had trouble with it. My experience has been excellent with all of my devices. Perhaps they have finally worked a lot of the bugs out of it. Anybody who has used Facebook knows about software bugs! Maybe my expectations weren't high. But my experience with Amazon and The Cloud player system overall has been better than most companies I deal with. As I said, I would recommend it to everyone!

That was my criteria for choosing this type of app. I like that we can play the music by accessing the amazon music cloud and not just by downloading each song on my kindle as long as I have wifi. I vary the amount of music I want loaded in my kindle and this app makes it easy and convenient to download individual songs or remove them and leave them only in the music cloud to save space. There is a limit to space available without paying for more and it is ok but not great. How can we complain though for a free app with free reliable service. The music streams seamlessly from the app or the cloud when playing, as well

I hate having to buy music threw a company that will only let me listen to it on their devices (without jumping threw hoops to download it).Amazon accepts most of my current library & let's me purchase music at the same or better rate as competitors. Another of my favorite features is the fact that the upload & download system is a smooth & seamless process (oh the frustration i tunes have caused me over the years).Another great feature is the format- MP3's, rather than one format that can only be used in that company's devices. Being such a universal format it's much easier to use in all kinds of devices.Having everything on the cloud is great too. I don't have to use up my devices' memory & I get the same [music] on all my devices with only doing the work of adding to one. That also means no more, "which device is that song on?"!I LOVE IT!

The app will only use the phone's internal memory to store all of its data. All the wasted megabytes for their album cover cache, and you can get about 15 or 20 albums at most on the phone (depending on other apps you have) before you will fill up an S3. Streaming is fine, but that only works when you are on Wi-Fi unless you want to eat up your small (these days) monthly G4 LTE bandwidth cap. Which is fine if you only listen to your music occasionally, but not so cool if you are an every day audiophile like anyone who would bother to pay a monthly fee for Amazon's MP3 cloud progam. So yeah, it's useless. Deleted app, canceling cloud subscription, will just use a competitor cloud product and rip CD's or whatever, if they can't make it convenient, then what good is it, really?

However if you only buy your MP3s from Amazon then this will be a nice app to keep so you can play them off the cloud if you don't want to download the music.

The app, mostly, performs as expected. It is simple and relatively easy to use. HOWEVER, the app does not allow you to download your music to your phone's SD card, it will only download to internal memory. This is a large inconvenience for those of us who do not always have a wifi signal or have 3g/4g data caps. I travel a fair amount of time and want to have my music available on those long flights. Plus listening to music on my phone's memory is much better on battery life than streaming.Other MP3 app makers have addressed this in their apps.  Google has recognized this issue with their Google Music app and has allowed download to SD since March 2012.  Why Amazon cannot figure this out is beyond me. In the end this will hurt Amazon more than its users. We, as users, have choice and the ability to walk away from AmazonMP3 and choose another music vendor. I can say that I have withheld purchasing many albums from AmazonMP3 for this reason.Until Amazon rectifies this omission from their app, I cannot, in good faith, give AmazonMP3 a positive review. 2 stars until this changes, 4-5 stars if Amazon gets on the ball and makes the fix.

You buy your music (the prices are very reasonable- to cheap) you download IF you want it on your device for anytime, anyplace listening. Or you can leave your tunes safe in the cloud so it does not take up any storage, you start the wireless and listen that way. Either way, the selection is nearly infinite. All the old classics to the newest hits....And best of all; NO Commercials!  And you don't have to listen to anything except what you want to hear. For listening on your phone or tablet, this is the real deal. No hidden fees. No upgrades. Just straight out jamming Your Way!

It has come a long way and only gets better. Online editing of metadata helps to fix my music collection and keep things organized. Their music is reasonably priced most of the time in comparison to other MP3 vendors out there too. My only minor complaint is on the recent device limits set. I have several android devices, which I think is probably making me more of an exception. Regardless, five as a device limit causes me to pick and choose more often than I like. Ten would be a better number.

I got it to work on my cell phone just fine, but how come I can't play Prime Music on my Kindle?  Doesn't make much sense.UPDATE6/20/2014 - When I first posted this, it was not available on the first generation Kindle Fire, however the I.T. people got right on it and now us original owners have the benefit of Prime Music.  Thanks Amazon!
A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y,B004FRX0MY,1.76524390244,0.391039299242,0.0338722093918,0.000384911470362,0.489,1.0,TRUTHFUL,UPDATE September 25, 2013: Since first using this with my old (and long gone) Droid X this software has deteriorated in one big way. On my Samsung Galaxy Note II I just discovered that this software downloads your music to the phone's internal memory and there is no workaround. So my new 64gb card is next to useless when I am purchasing MP3 albums from Amazon (which also sold me the 64gb SD card.) This is truly a brain dead piece of software for folks who frequently purchase MP3 albums. Factor that into your decision to download this and purchase MP3 music from Amazon. It's a no-win situation.Original Review:No doubt this is a convenient application and has made my Droid X my best friend (not to mention my dramatically increased number of purchases of MP3 albums from Amazon!)What I love most: cloud storage, and the fact that any MP3 music purchased from Amazon is stored for free, regardless of how much space it takes up. I also love the fact that whenever I purchase a new album it's immediately available to play from the cloud or to download directly to my Droid X.Now for the bad: if I am playing music for hours my device will freeze and I have to force the application to close. And when I say my device freezes, I mean everything until I get a pop-up informing me of such and asking if I want to wait, cancel or force it closed.Another issue I have is when I am downloading MP3 albums that come as disc 1 and 2 (or more), each virtual disc names the tracks with a number, then title. So when they download, virtual disc 1, track 1 downloads, then virtual disc 2, track 1 follows, and so on for every track. The track list is seriously out of order. This is a problem Amazon needs to resolve, even if it means a different naming convention for tracks from multiple virtual discs (i.e., disc 1 would be A-1-track name, and disc 2 would be B-1-track name or some similar scheme. It is not insurmountable.As for accessing my music from the cloud - I have scant luck playing songs from the cloud when I am driving and it's hit or miss at home unless I have WiFi turned on, so I am forced to play from songs stored on my device when I am not near WiFi. I have more music stored in the cloud than my phone will hold, which is why it can be a pain, but I think that may be a limitation of my provider (Verizon) instead of any shortcoming with Amazon. Just be aware that it can be an issue of the underlying technology, including your service provider's infrastructure.Despite my complaints, I have reached the point where I cannot live without the app, so I guess liking it is optional.

It amounts to 1-3 mb per day. This appears to happen even when it is not being used. Uninstalled!This would be a 5 star for me, but I can't see how to remove downloaded albums from the device. Downloaded playlists can be removed, but not albums. I had to remove each individual song one at a time, this took several minutes due to the slow toast notifications

I use it mainly on a motorcycle via bluetooth into my helmet speakers, so not always with the strongest cell signal and never wifi.  Amazon mp3 app stays connected more than any other internet music site, and reconnects the most when going in and out of service areas like on mountain roads.

The new version is only worth 1 star.  What is most annoying is that whenever I startup the app it spams me with a full screen ad for Prime music with no obvious way to get to my music.  I thought this trick was reserved for malware.  I finally discovered that pushing the back &#34;button&#34; twice quickly on my device  I could get to my music.  This is not how an app which is supposed to stream music I pay for (either by purchasing it or by subscribing to prime) is supposed to behave.  I really wish there was an alternative app.

Generous amount of uploads of my own music and unlimited storage of purchased music so a little incentive there to look around and see what Amazon has to offer.  Playlists and up to 10 devices so all members of the family can have their music- even iOs devices along with droid. One Wish: categories by genre: classical, pop, country etc are all mixed together so there's a bit of wading thru just to remember what's on there.

Granted it is too early to comment as the app is new but certain basic concepts are flawed.The most important for any phone or tablet is the limited space one has for storing music files and since this app saves music for offline listening into default internal memory and no way for the user to select where to store it (External SD card) it is very limited on how many songs you can save on the limited internal storage.It is never practical to be connected to Wi-Fi at all times on a portable device to listen to music from the cloud storage, it is also not practical to stream using your data plan all day so currently the app is flawed. I am sure eventually Amazon will release updates to fix this until then I have really no use for it on my phone and tablets.Also, there are number of bugs and more notably the app gives a lot of exception errors and asks to contact customer  service and the downloaded songs do not play. Even killing the app and restarting does not resolve the issue. Currently you cannot listen or re-download the songs till you clear your cache of this APP. If it encounters download errors (Which it does on a regular basis) you have no choice but to again kill the app clear the cache and re-download again or try again and again which is very frustrating.Also the album art goes out of sync when shuffling. The Song title does not match with the song it is playing, The album art disappears when you are not online on certain songs, the Equalizer does not seem to have no effect and the list of bugs goes on...It is indeed a nice offer from Amazon to allow unlimited streaming of popular songs to Prime Members but this APP should have been the first thing they must have paid more attention and get it right as all that effort that they have put into cloud services for streaming music is worthless without a proper working APP.I am rating this with 2 stars currently but I am positive Amazon will improve this in the future and I will revise my review accordingly.Thanks for reading my review.

I can listen to any of the 431 Albums of music I've purchased from Amazon (over the years) on my phone, With headphones it sounds as good as an iPod. The app either lets you listen to the cloud songs, or to songs that you downloaded onto your device, my case being my smartphone.I would recommend this app for anyone who has a smartphone or Kindle (prob other tablets too) and who purchases mp3 songs/albums from Amazon. I ALWAYS use WiFi so I don't use data on my phone data plan. I've had no glitches, no freezing, no issues at all.

It's nice to be able to put your own music in the cloud and purchase additional music.  The app doesn't seem polished though.

The Google Music Manager still has unlimited space for free (or when you purchase music from them). that's where I will be headed when Amazon says my time is up, rather than getting nickled and dimed to death and having to choose and upload those 25 songs. Bah bye, Amazon. my next tablet won't be a Kindle.

All my 10,000+ songs/podcasts are in Google Music and I stream from there. I prefer a local cache, and store in my 64GB microSD as well.Amazon does not give too much free storage, hence my decision not to use it on a daily basis.

I downloaded it a few days ago and there's no option to uninstall it and I have found it to be a completely useless app! I'm pretty upset about this as it is constantly running and taking up space. I'm moments from uninstalling everything Amazon-related on my phone and discontinuing use of any of their websites and services.

If you are a Prime member/subscriber, you get access to a good amount of free music. All you have to do is update the app and then you get access to "Add" songs to your library for free. Then, you can listen to the songs in the order you want and how you want. No ads and no skip limits! Not all new songs are available yet, but the selection is pretty good. Also, the app has settings that let you decide what quality of music file or streaming you want to use (to save on data if you are using your phone's plan). You also get the option to download the songs over WiFi and listen to them later without using up your data plan.A nice feature is the option to listen to preset playlists based on type of music or mood that you are in. The songs from the playlists are free (if you have Prime).App works well, and it is great if you have Prime! I would recommend it.

But it works great for me because I use several phones (one for each region I frequently travel to) and it's nice to have my music with me whenever I want to play them.  Best part of it is I don't have to load down the already limited memory of my phones with the entire library.  I can just stream the playlist (or artist, album, etc.) that I want to listen to.

But I only had a "stupid phone" not a "smart phone".  I wasn't eligible to get a "smart phone" until Oct 2010.  It was helpful for when my husband got a song and I wanted it...no need to find a thumb drive.  Just go get on amazon...sweet!  However, I wanted one of those smart phones.  I was looking at the EVO 4G, not the 3d one, and I was absolutely sold on it when I learned it came with this pre-installed.  However, waiting gets the best of us.  I decided to get Sprint's HTC EVO 4G View tablet.  I thought the 7" display would make me happier b/c face it, it might be cool with unlimited internet on that phone, but if you run the battery down or get tired of the 4 inch display it will frustrate you.  And this had wifi--something I already had at home and was used to using and will use a LOT.  It gave me internet when I needed it and wifi when I didn't.  This way I get what I wanted (android stuff) and I didn't have to wait.But definately one of my main reasons was to get away from itunes....can I have your credit card number every time I upgrade....uh no sorry I'm in the middle of dishes and I can't get that....plus if I buy something here, which I love doing for the points and other reason...then it's available on my PC...unlike on itunes where you have to have ipods connected to certain accounts and stuff and lots of log on things and hook the device to the computer.....this is much easier.  I got my tablet last Sunday and by today not only did I download all I wanted from my cloud...plus I can shop from the tablet...but I put all my old amazon songs on my card and it went into the cloud player...even the itunes stuff...with no problems.  No searching this folder or that.  I think I may have just replaced itunes and my ipod with my tablet and this cloud player.The only thing I didn't like was that for some reason I can't figure out how to not download a whole album...but that doesn't take away from this b/c I did figure out how to delete stuff from the player :)If you love amazon, want great music that is easy to get to, and want to go droid this app is great. I am currently shopping for music as we speak ;)

And I'm surprised that people so tech savvy have not figured out why they can't get the music to their SD cards. It's a business process, not a personal issue, or a technical aspect.I suggest they should put down their phones and live life a bit. Maybe even put a soundtrack to it.

Out of cheer curiosity I had to see why this app didn't have a full 5 star average. Turns out their phones suck and they're blaming the app. Here's an idea. If your phones not functioning correctly call your provider and get a new one. Than you'll be praying amazon MP3 for free early upgrades.

We have a kindle, three kindle fires and three Android phones in the family that heavily utilize Amazon apps. We have Amazon prime. We had the free upgraded cloud storage because of Amazon music purchases. But the cloud player really isn't worth the new $25/year, and the free 250-song limit is not going to cut it for us. So, we deleted our music from the cloud and are moving to google music.The Amazon mp3 app itself was ok, but never great. Leaving it is not a hard decision. Initially, I had imported all our music from iTunes. It copied the playlists, but nit the folder hierarchy, so dozens of organized playlists became a massive mess. Streaming worked ok, but obviously was heavily dependent ion the network connection. So I ended up copying my most-listened-to music to my sd card, and the built-in music player works very well.

It really does make purchasing music easier. I can buy the song and once it's in my cloud, I have access to it from whatever device I use - my tablet, my pc, my laptop or my smartphone. MUCH nicer than having to add the music manually to all of those devices.

Let me start this review off by saying its not the developers fault the your carrier decided to load ur phone full of bloatware. So don't just rate something 1 star BC ur pissed u can't delete bloatware.MY devices Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Samsung Droid Charge(Verizon)This app is great in my opinion. It does all it says. Cloud play is great. I read some ppl claiming that their music got lost. If this is the case for u make sure when buying ur music it was saved to the cloud drive. All music bought from amazon is free to store in the cloud and unlimited. However uploaded music is limited to 5gb which is quite small.  So when choosing b/w Google Music and Amazon that's something to consider. Both players are equally good. I think the deciding factor here is where you have bought more music. personally I have bought more from Amazon BC of the $5 alblums which are cheaper than what Google sells music for.1annoying thing is the app does emphasize the store part of the app as much as the player. The album view could also be made to look more aesthetic.

I've updated it, reinstalled it completely and it still will not show my songs.

My music just doesn't show up in the app. My husband also played with it, trying to get it to work, and had no more success than I.

This was one of Amazon's "Free App of the Day" so it was an easy choice to try. This wallpaper is a fairly simple game that allows you to explode regenerating pumpkins and knock vampire bats out of the air by tapping them in quick succession. This can cause the inadvertent launching of apps if you play this on a cluttered screen, so I only play it on a fairly empty screen.This is a seasonal app (at least for me) and I will likely change my wallpaper back to a picture of my family after Halloween.Recommended!

There are plenty of options for visual customization, but not a whole lot of gameplay, unless you create your own challenges like trying to keep the screen completely clear of targets or seeing how long it takes to get 1,000 points.To summarize, check it out if it looks good, play with it for 10 minutes, then uninstall &amp; go enjoy your Hallowe'en.

It does what it is supposed to do, and since it is a bit interactive it is one of the better wallpapers out there. I'm not sure what it will do to the battery, but I don't really care. I'll just have this on for the next week anyways.Another reason to look forward to Octobers.

However, with any live wallpaper, your battery is going to drain faster bc the background is constantly moving. so, this was kind of expected. anyway, all that said, this is a pretty sweet live wallpaper.

I just wanted to say thanks for the laughs. Some people have no business having a phone that's out of their league. Or the ones with crappy phones that complain about it. Ahahaha gave it high stars as I'm sure it does what its supposed to. Wouldn't give it five as just looking at the images I didn't see any I cannot live without.

Needs more professional graphics. Jagged edges, static fog and chopped smash animation sprites just ruin the immersion. But, beggars can't be choosers, and since it's free why not download?

I even forgot and left 3G on for hours yesterday, and my battery barely noticed.  In fact, I haven't even plugged this phone in to charge since then, which means that even with 3G my battery has never lasted longer.  Yes, the only difference from before is this screensaver/ wallpaper app.

Not so much because of &quot;graphics&quot; or &quot;worth,&quot; but because it was fun as hell! Everytime you touch a pumpkin or a bat they pop or fall out of the sky. Makes you giggle. Best part is that there is a counter in the corner that keeps a tally for you. My friend and I were always comparing scores. :) Have a little Halloween fun!

It is a quick app, doesn't slow down the phone and uses the battery intelligently.For those crying about the permissions, on mine, it is stopping animations when the screen is off, thus saving processing power and your battery.Yes, it should be set up as a game also, but I love the Live Wallpapers that are interactive. The graphics are very cartoonish, but a great free app.

I was happy to try out a Halloween themed wallpaper for a few weeks until Halloween passed but I am uninstalling it now.  You have some options with a few different backgrounds:-you can choose between 3 colors of fog and how much fog is on the screen.-choose how many pumpkins but u can not remove them all-there are bats that fly around on the screen which you can remove.I guess it can also be a game too since u can get points for smashing pumpkins and bats, it will keep track for you.  But that got old after 10 seconds.Parts of the app are nice but I would like to be able to remove all pumpkins or at least move them where I want, just so an apps icon is not sitting directly on top of one.  There was a pumpkin sitting directly underneath my camera apps icon and it made it semi difficult to see.5 stars for the app fitting the description.1 star for how much I want to use it.

This one is fairly boring, one of the reasons is that there is no randomness, i.e. the pumpkins always grow at the same spot and all the bats crossed the screen following the same direction (as far as I can remember). There are definitely better (free) alternatives out there. ASUS TF101

At least it will still let me view my clock background. Thanks to the author/s and Amazon!

The live wallpaper is almost like a mini game as you can tap on screen to make the jack-o-lanterns explode and the bats fall. There is a counter on the lower-left to keep track of how many you got. You are also able to select from 4 different backgrounds, fog amount and speed, pumpkin and bat amount. Overall this is a neat little app for this months event. The graphics look much better compared to the 4th of July fireworks live wallpaper app.

I found this app and installed it (it was $0.99 back then now its free) when I should it to our friends they were in awe that ours was so much more realistic... Its sad though the author has moved on and made this app free and has never made any more cases...The one thing I would love is if the author made one last change to allow user imported images for cases... if i could get 2 more requests then make a user selectable color scheme for the flame colors as well... (meaning chose one of the presets or a user selected color scheme)Thanx for making such a great app!

New posts can be written in WYSIWYG, but when I go back to edit, I can only do  it in HTML.  Pages don't display like they do on other browsers.  How do I know what to edit if I don't know what it looks like?Other problems include a clunky interface and an inability to schedule posts.Some good points: I can easily jump between my blogs.  Site stats are minimal but easy to read.  The reader is quick and efficient at fetching new posts, much better than Firefox on my computer.  Still not enough of a draw for me.

It makes it very easy to post - update - edit- to your blog. You can upload videos or images. It has a drop down for category so you can see which ones you are using. There isn't one for tags though. Something I wish I had known prior to using more tagging then categories on my site. Everything works pretty flawlessly.  You can browse to your gallery and then click share and share to your wordpress blog. My only problem is that if you post pictures through here and you have a lightbox plugin on your site it doesn't seam to allow the images to lightbox out . I have to repost them.

I'm still learning how to use it, but the WordPress for Kindle is a wonderful time saver. When you have a moment of inspiration it's so easy to just flip open the Kindle and start writing. Sometimes it takes forever to boot my laptop, and by the time it's ready I may no longer be. Thanks WordPress, and Kindle.

However, if you want to experience a genius use of IMDB, install the Google Chrome Browser onto your laptop or desktop. Then add the free IMDB extension for that browser.  Next time you are reading about a tv show or movie, highlight it with your cursor.  All of a sudden, the extension lights up on your toolbar with a red number.  That number is the rating for the movie or tv show.  If you want to read more, click on that red number and a new tab will open and you are there on the very page and can read the synopsis, reviews, cast list, etc., I use it every single day.

I guess Amazon and Motorola and Google are all paying each other off - because now I am stuck with FIVE apps from them that I cannot delete.

I love the app when looking for a movie, and I am kind of an IMDb junkie so in general like the tool.The thing that was bugging me was the news feeds. They would get stale, and couldn't figure out how to refresh (and I am talking by weeks not hours).So that may have been addressed in the last release.Also would be nice to attach to Amazon more(since it is owned by them) so I could watch directly or see pricing easier but I may just not know how to work that.The trailer stream great even at 3G which is good when you got to entertain a 4 yo for a few minutes.

I prefer the app layout to the mobile theme because it just looks a little cleaner.That being said, IMDb is one of those websites that I can't live without.  Before I discovered IMDb, something or someone would come up in conversation and we would rack our brains trying to remember an actor's name or the name of the TV show that was being discussed.  Usually we wouldn't remember it and then sometime, days later even, in the middle of something completely unrelated, the name would pop into my head...  Alan Tudyk!  THAT'S IT!.  With IMDB, I can easily find what I'm looking for an get the answer immediately, rather than days (or weeks) later.

Whether it's a premium service or not, I very much resent this kind of heavy-handed marketing. Enough said.

But, for me, it proved very useful today at a presentation where a former film critic for a major newspaper was discussing various films.  I was able to quickly access the IMDb website on my Kindle Fire, which proved quite useful in following the discussion.  I had previously used the website to look up movie times and to see where a movie was playing locally but I would not have used it in an audience setting if not for the app, which made it very easy to access the IMDb website.  For me, it's a valuable tool to have.

I discovered there are articles about certain programs that you can get. I'm greatly amused by all of the attention being paid to Downton Abbey that I wouldn't know anything about without IMDB on my phone. It's great for finding upcoming movies, too. Another very nicely done app.

It didn't take long to completely hate it. In any case, Amazon now says it's not compatible, so my assumption is that the app was upgraded and doesn't work well on KF now. In truth, I wouldn't know because of the reason I stated before; I don't like it, so I don't use it anymore and let me tell you why.* It only displays the abbreviated version of IMDb and is difficult to navigate. I love the Trivia items and it is a pain in the neck to find the link on any given page.* Unlike using the web browser, you cannot search the page for text. When you are perusing a prolific star's list of films or TV, it is very tedious looking for one lone title. Page text search is an absolute must have.* Also it doesn't offer tabbed viewing. I like opening up various pages in separate tabs, so I don't have to constantly hit the back and forward buttons.Really, those are my only complaints but those are all the complaints I need to make me decide to never use it again.There is one more point I wish to make and this is in their favor. One reviewer complained saying that you still have to be connected to the net in order to use it and so found it useless. Yes, you do have to be connected but can you imagine the size of download that would contain all of that information? We're talking hundreds of thousands of pages! If you've ever tried usingiBird Pro 2you'll know right away what I'm talking about.iBird Pro 2has less than 1,000 entries and is an enormous, time consuming, pain in the butt, download. Imagine that a hundred times worse. Yep, that's what you'd get.The point of the app is to make it fast. I will admit that it IS fast. It loads a lot more quickly than the web version. That said, the two complaints I have still trump it's speed.Sorry, IMDb. Your app stinks. Fix those two problems and make sure it's KF compatible and I'll be satisfied.

I got it as a FAOTD last week and it is the only game I have been playing since then. It is a hybrid of a Boggle type word game and an RPG. The game begins in dungeon 1. You are given a random set of letter tiles to create words. The words you make are given point scores. The points are considered spells to defeat monsters that vary from 3 point rats to 98 point dragons. The point power of your words slay the monsters. This game is very engaging. The letters available for each dungeon even vary slightly because the more letters you use, the more bonus tiles, that can only used once, show up. I wish I didn't like this game quite so much. My house would be clean again!

I wasn't sure of what do do with my "winnings".  I found out I am really bad at spelling long words and got tired of the same short words over and over again. If you are a good speller you will probably like this game. Kids will like this because of the graphics.

I found one setting turned off the jumble feature. Obviously those complaining about this never checked the settings or help. My problem with the settings, though, is that the current state is not displayed. Each time you touch the option button, it goggles to the opposite state. If that's not the one you want, you have to toggle again.I started with the kids mode just to sample the interface and game play. So far so good. It's not a true RPG. You advance a level (dungeon) by making words. The higher the value of the word the more destructive it is against the level's monster. Each fight depletes some of your health. When out of health the game ends.Final word: be skeptical of low ratings.  The player probably didn't spend much time playing the game. And if someone says they'll never buy anything from this developer in future there may be more to the story than the game play.

It's a mix of a lot of things to keep you preoccupied. It's a bit like scrabble, where you are given a set of letters to make words in order to 'defend yourself' after you have been attacked by mice, skeletons, etc. You face these beings in dungeons, and these dungeons are shown on a World Map. The map shows where you are, and how many dungeons you will have to go through (which are a lot).You are able to choose your own game mode, and these are your options:Kid Mode - starts with extra health, words do double damageNormal - Standard RulesWizard - Experts only! Starts on Dungeon 4. No oracle tilesYou really have to get creative with the words, for you cannot use the same word twice (it seems ever), so I can see this being a perfect game for a person really into puzzles.For me personally it was a pretty good game, but I don't think I would get through the entire map in one sitting. It's definitely something for me to check into every once and a while when I'm bored, because it is a challenging game, it's just a tad redundant.However, once you amass a certain amount of points there are extra squares you are given that have powers that play to your advantage (like a healing one, extra points, oracle eye that creates the best word out of all your letters, etc  etc).But I love the added paranormal-ish element to it - it's not just a regular word game. There are probably added features that I haven't gotten to (I'm on the fifth dungeon right now), so I can't wait to see what else is offered. I also appreciate that there are different modes, so you can practice a little and receive hints on how to play in the kid mode before attempting the normal or wizard modes.

It plays kind of like Wizardry but mixed with scramble. Very challenging, nice looking at something different. Works flawlessly on my DROID razr
A1DG75OT3Y49EM,B004GISE8C,0.662921348315,0.38537414966,0.0253036437247,0.0,0.189,1.0,TRUTHFUL,You start each dungeon (level) with several letters and 15 hit points. You face multiple enemies one after another and form words to attach their hit points. They attack as well and you will lose HP as you play. Longer words hit harder and so on. As you kill enemies you also get special letters worth double HP attacks or magic pieces that tell you the best word to attack with. Your hit points are reset and you keep unused special pieces after each level.So basically Boggle with a theme.Unlike many reviewers I didn't think much of the game. It has a very boring interface, low Res graphics - each dungeon is a door with enemies in front of it. If this game were a true dungeon crawler with the ability to move where you wanted and to have random enemies encounters and maybe a point this would be better. I am thinking of an old school dungeon crawler on a PC aand this setup doesn't compare. There isn't even a story.But it isn't a data miner and the game works so 3 stars. Just OK.

When you die in the game, you start over. Not the level, no... the entire game. Back to the first dungeon. Also, apparently I have to be very careful about hitting quit, otherwise your progress won't be saved. Other than those two issues I have, the game is fun. I feel a little helpless when I can't find a new word though.

It keeps you on your toes, because as you get along farther, of course the harder it gets, especially when you HAVE to make four letter words.I'm thinking that the next time, I better choose the book of luck. :)I might be alone on this, but I'd give it 6 Stars if I could.

Possibly because they don't know how to read and thought it was an rpg when it clearly reads word game. I think its a lot of fun!

It is also a bit Monty Hall when looked at as a quest game instead of purely as a timed word game.It is a challenging word game, especially when you are attempting to make a word from rapidly shifting letter tiles.  I also find the objects found after defeating the various foes pretty amusing.All in all, a cute little word game with an interesting slant, good for a waiting-room game.  With a little more complexity (ie collecting found items for a bonus,  or perhaps an honest-to-goodness quest), and the option to save your progress,  this has the potential to be a 5-star game.

It's an okay word game, special only in that it doesn't have the fatal flaws of many word games.  The dictionary is adequate, and the tile distribution has a reasonable balance of consonants and vowels, which almost always allows for the formation of many words of 3-8 letters.  The infusion of elements of Hack or Rogue are purely cosmetic--there are monsters with varying degrees of hitpoints that one fights (in this game, by forming words as opposed to moving into them), and treasures produced by a "you have found an [adjective] [noun]" generator (in this game, the treasures are absolutely pointless, serving only at populate a long list of stats at the game's end and to provide momentary amusement at the end of a level).  This game's strange amalgamation of unrelated elements shouldn't work--but somehow, it DOES.An unusual and much appreciated feature in this game is that it is quite possible to win--to complete all 25 levels in a single, admittedly longish, sitting.  It's nice to be able to reach closure before becoming sick of playing the game.  The game designer(s) seem to also be well aware that introductory levels can be a necessary ramp-up for some players and teeth-grittingly tedious for others; the "Wizard" mode allows players to start at level 4.

Was really fun but I finished it in one hour from beginning to end without dying even once. Just a little too easy. Don't even bother with the "expert" mode, it's not hard either. Wouldn't pay 2 dollars for this so thank goodness it was TAOTD.

I like word games such as Text Twist and RPG/Sim games too. This game blends them together nicely. There are 3 levels of difficulty Kid Mode, Normal, and Wizard. I started with Normal. You are given letter tiles with which you have to make words to defeat enemy creatures and monsters of variable strength and attack speed. That's right, the enemies don't just stand there while you &quot;cast spells&quot; (make words) at them, they fight back! This basically serves as a timer to make words. Along the way you can earn magic tiles and power ups to help you make words, increase damage to enemies, increase your health etc. I beat Normal on the first try but it was a little challenging towards the end. I assume Kid Mode is really easy for anyone to play. I'm definitely going to try Wizard mode though. Replay value is moderate. I would have given 5 stars but when I beat the game, I couldn't enter my name and post it to the leader board. I tapped the space to type my name but the keyboard wouldn't appear. I'm using the stock keyboard, not an app. Please fix this! HTC Thunderbolt stock rooted.

I hadn't seen it before and probably would have paid for it as it sounded so intriguing.  I usually don't like timed word games as I'm not all that fast, but this one providers a reason to hurry besides a clock ticking - create quickly or die!  I like that!  It gives you the choice of three levels , kids, normal, or wizard which is great though I haven't checked out kids or wizard yet.  So I'm enjoying it so far and if I find it gets harder where I'm dying all the time, I can (shamefully) move to the kids level.

I only downloaded itbecause the cover looked cool. In the game you get attackedby skeletons and bats, so you have to unscramble words tosave your life.

I went thru the normal made with no problems.  gonna try the higher level now. good fun!

I ended up deleting it from my list of apps.  Since it was a FAOTD it was worth a shot, but I wouldn't pay for this.  There are other word games out there that are much better.

However I did get a few force close issues. Game is paused and let it sit for a while, return to un-pause game and force close. You do loose your progress which is a bummer. Other than that this is a very fun addictive game. Highly recommend.

These words are like magic spells and they destroy the various creatures living in the dungeon.  There are 25 dungeons that need your skills. If your word is too small it will not destroy the evil creature you are fighting.  It takes multiple words to kill some creatures and you are facing a timer.  The letters don't get added very quickly so you are using the same letters to form as many words as possible out of mostly the same letters so it can get difficult.  There are special tiles to increase damage, restore health, and many other features but they don't come often in the game. They are described in the Help section of the game so I will not go over the long list here.This is a pretty good word game and the killing of the creatures is just a little twist to keep you entertained.  I like the power up tiles and they do help a lot.  I didn't care that whenever you get defeated you have to start all the way back to the first dungeon again.  I was in a higher dungeon level, about 5 or 6 levels in and the timer ran out and I finally got beat and I had to start the journey all over.Touching Scores does let you see scores on the world score board or you can see your local scores only if you want.  This is one of the features that make me always wonder what else is being shared with the world?  This is why I do not like full internet access as you always wonder what else is going on.  As a single player game it doesn't really need internet access and this unnecessary permission should be turned off.  When you complete your game it asks for your game name and you can save your score and choose not to share your score with the online server.The help instructions are good and take the time to read them as they can be helpful to get you quickly up to speed. The game played well on the Kindle Fire and I turned the music down to an acceptable level using the Kindle's volume slider.I gave the game 4 stars as I thought it was a good game.  The one star deduction is for having to start over at the beginning if you lose after getting multiple levels into the game and for having full internet access.  Making you start over just makes the game action redundant and not nearly as much fun as seeing new creatures and challenges in a game.  I detected no spyware or data mining going on.Options:* Toggle all sounds on/off* Toggle music on/off* Shake to jumble letters* Reset quick tips* Reset high scoresMain Screen:* Play* Scores* Options* Help* About - a long list of creditsPermissions:Network communication - full internet accessSize is 7.9 MB uncompressed and once it installed the 224 KB went into the Kindle Fire app memory and 12.506 MB went into the memory reserved for you books and other data.

It cleverly integrates elements of RPG games into a word creating game, such as HP points, leveling up certain abilities, and gaining helpful items that persist to the next dungeon.  If you enjoy word games, then this is an automatic winner.The gameplay starts with a map of all the dungeons (total 25), showing your progress and how far until you beat the game.  Once you enter a dungeon you are presented 8 letter tiles that will always remain the same for the duration of that dungeon.  A random monster will appear and starts attacking your HP, which will gradually drop down to 0 if you cannot defeat it in time.  To defeat the monster, you cast spells by combining the tiles to make words with at least 3 letters.  The bigger the word, the stronger the spell.  You cannot use the same word twice, so a wise tactic is to use smaller words for the weaker monsters, and bigger words for the stronger monsters.  Sometimes, you gain loot from killing a monster, which can include new one-time-use letter tiles that can add bonus damage to your spells, potions to regain HP, and special abilities to automatically cast the largest word possible.  Some monsters are "boss" monsters, and once defeated rewards you with a choice to upgrade your wizard abilities (e.g. +1 damage to all spells, better chance to find loot, increase HP, decrease monster HP).The game starts off difficult at first, but once you get the hang of it, you'll find yourself reaching the final dungeon and beating the game.  There are three difficulty levels to choose from, so the game is accessible and can challenge you further if normal becomes too easy.  This all extends the replay value and continues to make it fun.I highly recommend getting this game.  Runs great on my Samsung Captivate (Galaxy S) and Acer Iconia tablet.

I was hoping for more of the dungeon for instance, being able to move around the dungeon would add lots of opportunities for added features, choices based on word puzzles, lock picking a letter combination lock, etc.  So didn't fulfilled my hopes but, in case there are future updates, it's a good start.

I actually worked a little harder to find longer words which I was able to do. So far I have only made it to level 8 and when you make it this far you are occasionally given a cool book of lore which gives you a choice between two rewards. It does seem to get challenging in a hurry, but that is okay with me because it last about the right amount of time for playing. I am happy that it closes when you exit the game.  Also I thought the game gave enough vowels and appropriate consonants to actually be able to spell words. I feel intrigued enough to want to keep playing. Highly recommend.

However, probably 1/4 of the time, the mixing button is on at startup, and makes the game unplayable.  Also the save game state never works.  But other than that, it's fun.

It is similar, with an RPG twist added to it. The bonus tiles make it more interesting as you're battling the monsters. My only complaint is that it's too short!

Simple words like &quot;Is&quot; &quot;the&quot; &quot;are&quot; don't work. as well as more complex words... lame.. I think a kid wrote this....

ITS JUST A GOOD FUN GAME! PLUS IT WAS FREE SO Y COMPLAIN??? ;P

When I open it again,  the game has started over.Then,  my last game I got to level ten on normal mode and out of nowhere the game to my touch.  I helplessly watched as I went from 20 hp to death.  What a waste.  Great concept,  game breaking bugs.  It wouldn't  be fair if I didn't write the developer to try and solve this,  so I will,  and we will see if my rating changes.

I liked the challenge of it, but moved on as it is a word game and most of the word games are similar in themselves

Words keep going through  mind!  I did not know I would enjoy a word game so much.  This is an easy game to play.  Wish it would let you redo a level when you run out of life.  Great game.  Thank you.

A18HE80910BTZI,B004GISE8C,1.66292134831,0.421159754224,0.0137795275591,0.0,0.191,0,TRUTHFUL,The game is so & so. Actually not very bad, It is dark and The primary object of the game is to make words from the available letters and the longer the word the better is the score. It also seems to be a game with magic spells and they destroy the various creatures living in the dungeon, there are about 25 dungeons. You need to come up with words that can destroy the creatures that live in the dungeons. Some creatures require multiple word solving skills to destroy them so you get the idea what this game is about.There are help screens that explain the rules and controls are simple and works perfectly on kindle fire. Overall it is plain old word game but with a twist wherein you get to kill creatures by solving word puzzles.The game needs full internet access but can be played by turning off WiFi. The price is little on the higher side, wished it would be just 99c like most of the apps. But, if you love dark dungeons and want to solve word puzzles and the same time the price of $1.99 seems justified.

It has humor, too, which is sometimes lacking in word games.My only criticism is that is like the findings to mean something, to have a purpose.  A story line would help as well.Even though the game is short, it has replay value.  I would like more maps, however.In all, I enjoyed the first time through and will play it again.  Good job Robinson family!

I do and I enjoyed it. My tips - save the longer words and the power-ups for the more challenging enemies later in each dungeon (you're told how many fights are left) so you can defeat 'em and continue the game.

A334SLFQ5WGVAM,B004GISE8C,0.337078651685,0.414735125985,0.0154291224687,0.0,0.378,0.5,TRUTHFUL,Dungeon Scroll is a pretty good word game, one that would have been better if it wasn't so full of little annoyances.It cleverly combines "Typing of the Dead" with word puzzles, and does so almost flawlessly.You create words by using the provided letters every level, and use them to cast spells, which in turn kill the monsters that try to do the same thing to you.I like the little twist it puts on the regular word puzzler by letting you re-use your letters to create new words. To balance this out, the game stops you from using the same exact word once it is used. You are allowed however, to use variations. So you can type "night", and then "nights" right after.This word block is reset every dungeon (level), so once you get past your current level, you are free to re-use the words used in your previous one.By killing monsters and descending deeper into the dungeon, you will get treasures, which are "power up" letters or potions that will carry over from level to level. Using these in word creation results in everything from healing to bonus damage.The graphics and sound, while nothing to write home about - are more than adequate for a game of this type.If it wasn't for the annoying network permission and the ability to go to the rtsoft.com website (where you can purchase more games from the developer), it would be almost perfect.I also don't appreciate them sneaking their Twitter and newsletter options into the Help menu.Finally I have an issue with the game not allowing you to continue where you left off after you die. You can save the game by quitting, but I was on level nine and was destroyed by a particularly nasty critter, forcing me to restart the game from the start.A better solution would have been to send you back one level, or allow you to use a resurrection scroll that you could find every few levels.Now I don't quite think this game is worth $1.99 (twice what similar word games go for), it is certainly a good FAOTD. If it ever goes down to $.99, I would also recommend it, but for the price of two games it is not quite worth it.
A3HPIPUJNJ5SX3,B004GISE8C,0.662921348315,0.501957671958,0.0272727272727,0.0,0.11,0.5,TRUTHFUL,Really, this one is about a 3.5 for me.  However, I can't rate it that, so I rounded it down.  It's not good enough to round up to 4.The gameplay is simple enough, make words to defeat monsters.  However, it can get tricky because you get the same letters throughout an entire dungeon.  So, if you fight a bunch of bad guys, you can run out of ideas.  If that happens, you'll probably die.To be honest, I probably wouldn't have paid money for this game.  But, it was free today and it looked decent, so I got it.  Maybe I'll like it better over time.

I could care less for the story line but the game with its levels and bonus letters is fun and challenging. The dictionary that you play with has words that even people with a good vocabulary will never find them all. I like that it reminds you if you have already used a word. and that it allows plurals and other varients of the same word. Makes the game fun even for the children. It has three levels of play and that is good too. Over all its a little above average. Not my favorite game but certainly not one to uninstall the first day you have it.

But other than the graphics the game is basically a word game. The graphics and monsters create a sense of urgency and makes me feel that I am really fighting in the dungeon. This is a very easy game to play and works well on my Kindle. Love it. good game.

I got it for something different.  I was getting bored with the same old games I already had.  I am still on the "Kid Mode", and find it difficult.  I can only imagine what the "Normal" and "Wizard" modes are like.  One mode at a time.My only gripe is that it does not recognize some basic everyday words.  And then, when it gives you a word, it is usually one I have never heard of.

My biggest complaint is that your progress is not saved along the way. For example if you reach the 10th level and then die, you get to start all over again from level 1.

However, with the way the letter generator works, and the fact that you can't reuse words, it seems easy that you could find yourself in a corner. I don't know if there is a tile for recycling letters, but there should be an option. Would also be nice to save progress, as this seems like a long game to play all at once on a mobile device.

When this happens, you can only sit there helplessly and watch yourself lose. I'd rather lose based on my own abilities not because the randomness of the game left me without any ability to continue. Fix this and you'll get your fifth star. May I suggest some sort of scramble option, even if it cost you points or abilities or something? May I also suggest code that makes absolutely sure there are 1 or 2 vowels in the letters at all times? Thank you!

I am a big fan of word games and the extra challenge of finding words to kill dungeon monsters makes this word game really fun! I loved the concept! my only complaint is that it was a little too easy on normal mode. I finished all 25 levels in about 45 minutes. I am looking forward to trying it on expert mode next. definitely worth the free download today! if you like word games like boggle or scramble, you will almost certainly like this game too! Also has a kids mode. based on the difficulty level of normal mode, kids mode would probably be fun for kids between 9 and 12.

If you are just looking for a perfect sound  or voice recorder for you tablet, then look no further but as far as recording song and music ideas, look else where.

Not professional, but makes a great concept song recorder on the road.

I had unlocked the door so I could open it to let fresh air flow in the place. Now sitting at my desk doing paper work,  then with out warning four of my friends rushed in scared the heck out of me! They took my phone off my desk and left, to say the least I was not in the mood to chase my phone down! When they returned and gave my phone back, man what a fantastic surprise. I opened my phone to my last screen now loaded with a &#34;full blown&#34; MUSIC RECORDING STUDIO! The main component is the J4T Multi Track Recorder! I spent the rest of the day putting it thru its paces. I was amazed! It performed rather well,  all so very awesome Thank You!  Are there any plans to develop other Gear?

The device is no longer upgradable, and is stuck at 2.1 or something. Few of the newer apps work on this device but I just got it last Sept from Woot at a deep discount and want to keep it as my tablet for now. I get such a charge when something works well, and the sound quality from the eDge is great to my tin ears. The Amazon apps are very hit or miss for this discontinued brick so I will be happy when I can get a K-Fire (II?) down the line.

You get one free audible book and after the first month, there is a monthly fee.  If you are pinching pennies this might not be for you.  You get a free credit each month for one free book.  To me, that more than pays for the fee.  There are also offers for books that can be purchased at low rates. I bought a book for $7.95 this month.  It's a very good deal, for me. It's easy to order books...I go to audible.com on my desktop computer, browse through the books, and place my order. I wait a few minutes, go to my Kindle and bring up the Audible book App...click on download. Some books take several minutes to download...Easy Peasy! I love it, you can control the volume and the speed of the reader.

This latest version of the audible player for Android is not as good as the older Audible player versions.The newest version starts with a smiley photo of someone allegedly having fun listening to Audible audiobooks. But it's a waste of time and memory space. Also, the app needs to synchronize & authorized your book files every  time it opens now. That little process is achingly slow. And it only affirms the stuff on your machine. If you really want to download the newest audio digest newspaper from your account, you have to sync again with your online library...more time waiting....For me, it's better than not having Audible, but I wish Amazon wouldn't mess with things so much making the app worse in operation trying to tighten the ties between Audible & Amazon. What I expect to happen sometime down the line is that Audible will disappear as branding and only Amazon will remain. The service will become some &#34;AudioKindle&#34; thingy in time.It saddens me, but as I said, you can't go back again. They won't let us.

Since I listen to audiobooks while working outside, an mp3 player was the better choice, but not compatible.  I have a Samsung Galaxy Player and it worked fine.  No problems.

Back then, it was easier and cheaper to convert the books to CD than to get an MP3 player with enough capacity to hold a whole book.  But that's a whole other story.Pretty much, I love the app.  It syncs up just fine, loading in all the books in my library that I have bought over the years.  I can shop directly from the app, so I can grab a new title while on the road.  I like that I can start listening even before a book download is completed, especially given the size of some of them.  The app offers several sorting methods, plays just fine in the background, and I have yet to have it crash on me.  The color scheme works well, easy to read.  The 30 second reverse button is handy, especially if a loud vehicle or some other distraction comes along and drowns out the sound.  When calls come in, it pauses nicely and resumes when I end the call.There are two things I don't care for however, which is why the app only gets four stars instead of 5.  One is that it doesn't seem to always remember what it was doing last.  If I pause the playback, exit the app, then come back, it may and may not remember what it was doing at the time.  When it doesn't remember, it puts me back at the main library menu, leaving me to scroll back to the book and part that I was listening to.  It always remembers where in the book/part I left off at least.  The second thing is the interaction when I get a notification.  The notification tone overrides the app, causing me to miss whatever was said for the duration of the tone.  (That's another point where the 30 second reverse button is handy.)  While I don't have long notification sounds, someone who does will miss quite a bit.

I do most of my buying of Audible files through this app and hardly ever go to the website.  It is very convenient to have all of the files here on my phone that I carry around with me all the time.

If you don't like Audible.com then this app isn't for you. The App for Audible is perfect for keeping up on books while I'm on the go. I listen to books while I drive, do dishes, sweep out the garage.Features:You can add bookmarks where you're listening so you never loose your place. These bookmarks sync to your account so you can pick up on your Kindle and then pick right back up on your phone. It's also good for when you switch to a more exciting book and don't want to start over (guilty). Narrator speed is great too. I don't know how it does it, but I listen to my book at 1.5x the speed and the narrators voice doesn't get any higher - just faster. I once listened to an audio book at a higher speed on another app, and it sounded like Peewee Herman was my narrator. I also like that I can delete and add books right from that app so I only download what I want on my devices at that time since my entire library of purchases is in the cloud ready for download.

I have been an Audible subscriber for 10 years = many, many audio books in my library.  There are  NO JUMP LINKS in this app.  If I want to get to a title that starts with &#34;W&#34;, I have to scroooooooollllllll alllll the waaaaaayyy to the boottttttttoooom.  Give us the option of an alpha jump list!!  It's not rocket science.I'm not too impressed with Amazon for Apps either.  It took about 12 times of searching for this app for Amazon to spit it out in the search results.  I really like the Android mini-tablet but the software offerings are not quite yet ready for prime time.

I was very comfortable and savvy with the Audible manager and my MP3 player.  Even after I bought my smartphone, I continued to use the MP3 player set up for a good while.  Finally, my MP3 player bit the dust and I was faced with the prospect of either buying a new MP3 player or learning the app.  I was reluctant at first, but now I simply love it!  Keeping one's place with the app is a breeze, and recent purchases just automagically show up!  Now add the wonderful Whispersync for voice and I am truly impressed.  This is a wonderful app.  It is smart enough to know when the headphone jack is pulled out and stops the book.  This has come in handy when I'm listening in the car and quickly have to stop playback to hear a siren, answer a hands-free call, etc.  That was something my MP3 player could never do.

I seem to have less time for books and more time to listen. I really take pleasure in listening while relaxing with my needles in the evenings. I like reading as much as I like being productive so with audible I can do both. I give it 4 stars because the price is way too high. Unless you buy the book first, you can get a discount on some audio books. Some of them I never read, just listen. I would buy more audio books if the price was lower, because I really enjoy it. Even though I have an iPad I still and always will buy my books and music from Amazon because Apple's customer service sucks. I'm happy that I can get my Amazon contents and have it on my iPad. All my audio books downloaded automatically on the audible right after I downloaded the app.One thing if you put the voice of the reader on fast  it skips words and sounds like mumble jumble. If you put it on a slower read it just sounds like echo.

I love that I can change the speed of the book I'm listening to and skip between channels, the latter being something I can't do on my current player unless the files are split into chapters (the former I couldn't do until I bought an add-on). Otherwise, this is a clean and easy to use app that I've really enjoyed and has worked flawlessly on my Galaxy S3.

You have to sign up for the subscription of $14.95/month that gives you one credit a month.  A new John Grisham novel is listed at $35!!!  How many credits does each book cost - varies.  It's very tailored to get you to also buy a Kindle.I also cannot get my old title transferred to the &#34;new&#34; Audible.  I keep entering my old log-in info, it will say it was accepted but then returns to log-in screen.  Chat is not working to merge my accounts, so I have to call.  The desktop program is like something from the early 90's and I can't transfer books to my android phone.  Spent hours trying to manually transfer the book - no go.  Instructions are a mess, files are cryptic and you can't find anything and don't know if the app downloaded the book or is streaming it.  It is listed under both tabs, yet I can't listen to one of my books.  I don't know if the one I can listen to is being stream or is actually downloaded to my phone.  Files are tied to your log-in, NO SHARING with someone else who had Audible!I've been around long enough to have lost songs I purchased when the &#34;proprietary licensing&#34; is no longer supported.  Apparently this happened to the old Audible.  AND you will NOT be able to listen to your books without the Audible software.  So if you decide not to subscribe, you have to keep it loaded on your device to listen to that book you just spent a fortune on.CD's are less expensive, easier to convert to MP3, and then you can give it to as many friends as you'd like, same with a paperback book.  Better yet, start uploading them to Pirate Bay - I now see why they exist when companies pull this cr*p.  It would be one thing if digital media was less expensive, but it's more expensive!  One book or audio CD can be passed around and resold and there's no risk of it becoming unusable because of a format change.Stick with your library or go buy something you can actually keep and share.  CD's aren't dead as far as audiobooks go.

Great app very intuitive, stop and pick up where you left off. I have not tried the listen to and then switch over to reading in the kindle app where you left off listening in the audible app, but I believe since they are sister apps why would they not work flawlessly? I like some of the books offered in the audible selection, there is enough audible books to keep my attention. I like that they offer daily specials at deep discounts!

This app works well with the KIndle (fire hdx). I also have it for my phone (Samsung GS4). Works great with both devices. I like that it gives you the option to sync if you wanted to, or you can start over. Say if someone else wanted to start from the beginning I guess.

I purchased 2 Audible versions of books I own so wanted to be able to also listen using my cell phone (Android) when I don't have my Kindle. I downloaded this APP, signed in to my account and got an error message &#34;Password Error&#34; over and over again - 4 separate times, removing the App, then reinstalling it, retyping email address and password, repeatedly.... Ugh! So, I  decided to use the Online Technical Support Chat option to find out what was going on. I then get somebody who's even more ignorant than myself so, in my opinion, this App has been a huge waste of time. Sure hope Audible's products are okay with my Kindle because I sure can't use it for my cell. If this is how Audible performs, I will be quickly cancelling my account.

Select just the icon or select a more fully functioning widget.  I like that you can sort based on length, date of purchase, author or title.  I like the graphic that easily identifies that the book is new, that you've completed listening to XX-percentage of the book or that you've completed the book.  All-in-all it does just what I would expect it to do.

It is unbelievably convenient to download books directly whenever you want them! No mucking with awful iTunes.  I've been with Audible for nearly ten years now and this app is far and away the best listening experience I've ever used with the service.Audible itself is wonderful. You can read in so many places it's impossible to take a book. A good book makes your workout or commute fly by! It's a little weird at first--having books read to you--but if you stick with it, you'll quickly come to love Audible too.

This is a huge step up from their old windows mobile software.

If I'm on wireless I can download new content from Audible.There's no need for this app on the latest Fire HD.  I use this on my First Generation Fire.  Unfortunately if you have a First Generation, Amazon stopped supporting it with software upgrades a while back so the latest and greatest will not come your way.

I always pull out my phone and see if Amazon has it and then tell them to get it on Amazon. I have made a couple of one click purchases on it in an emergency but otherwise I never use this.I pull Amazon up on my browser because this app really only has 2 functions: search for items, one-click. I can't view my orders, my account, track packages, or anything like that.I would just like to have more options that what is provided. Also, the layout is very difficult to navigate. I mean, if you are a loyal Amazon fan like me I'd download it just to have it but don't expect to use it much.99% of the time I just pull Amazon up on my phones browser since the app is so useless.

It's a bit more difficult to filter the results than on a page, or but the application is a bit easier to use. They have struck an excellent balance between simplicity and utility.

The only reason 4/5 stars is because missing (a) sort by price (b) needs input field to apply promos.  Otherwise if you shop on Amazon, this is must have app.

It runs really smooth on my evo, makes shopping on amazon a breeze. Much easier to use than a mobile web browser to view the web page on your phone. I use it frequently when I am out shopping and want to check prices and reviews. Amazon is almost always cheaper than local stores, so its an easy way to save money.Ordering items through the app is very easy. I have completed the process several times and had no errors or order problems.The one problem I have with this app is the bar code scanner. I can almost never get bar code scanners to work and this app is no different. I often feel like an idiot standing in a store trying to get this app to read a bar code. On the flip side, the app almost always finds the item I am looking for when I search via keyword search or texting a picture.

I'll be all up in Walmart looking at hammers or shovels or bone saws or something and the Amazon app is all like "Yo dawg, I'll get you that sheeeiit for half price AND I'll ship it right to your house fo FREE!" When the Amazon Prime benefits kick in it's a joyous occasion. I'm celebrating this app's magnificence with 5 stars. Do it.Do it.

It also provides me with the invaluable knowledge of the Amazon rating system that we all feed with our comments.I'm not going to add a bunch of pro's and con's here about the current version. We should reserve those for the feedback tool that the Amazon developers have.I will just add that the barcode scan and the photo recognition tools work phenomenal and the query is very quick. So, whether you grabbed something at The-X-store and want to see how good it is because it caught your eye, or if you are sure you want it, but you are concerned abut the price, this application will very likely help you decide what to do about it.

This allows you to either search a product by entering the name or, my preferred method, scanning the bar code and then comparing the price and looking at the customer ratings and reviews. It has more than once stopped me spending more than needed (although I like to shop locally when the cost is comparable) and from buying poorly rated products.Recommended!CFH

You can only narrow a search by department.  The mobile web site is much better than using this app. I don't understand why an app would have less functionality than the mobile web site. Uninstalled.

However, last week I was prompted to update it so I did.  What a mistake!  Now it doesn't work.  It says it does not support digital purchases.  Then in physical merchandise, there is no Buy button.  So it doesn't work!  I've got it installed on a Samsung Galaxy 3S phone, the same device I've had it on for over a year.  So it was that last update that rendered it unusable for Samsung products.  If you have it already and it is working, DON'T UPDATE it!

The other marketplaces could learn a lot from the Amazon Appstore App. There is just one frustrating failing that really needs to be addressed soon. If you delete an app and REALLY don't want it any more there is NO WAY to remove it from your list of Apps in the Appstore App. It just sits there forever, cluttering up the interface. Huge over sight that quickly devalues the interface and usability for anyone that (un)installs more than a few apps.

Crazily enough some of us may be too busy to fill out some long review about an app for our phone or tablet. That's not to say its not a good app but I'm just saying requiring us to type something seems like a dick move, maybe you'll consider changing it or maybe I'm just blowing smoke but more often then not I opt to not do reviews because I don't feel I should be required to type anything. Thanks for the app.

I was eager to rid myself of tmobile for years and had my eye on the galaxy note II all fall. I patiently watched the prices for this phone for two months- eagerly waiting for the price to drop. A few weeks before christmas I realized amazon was offering this phone with a new contract for half the price of and other major phone company.I am beyond pleased.YAY amazon!

Does it show up as a little blue icon in your taskbar every couple of hours saying there are updates to it, or other things you buy with it? The Appstore app does that, with the orange icon showing up several times a day "asking" you if you would like to update it.  Soon as you clear it out, it comes back a couple of hours later.  Also, the apps you download have updates (however major or minor), and every time an app has an update (that you either want or don't want), the Amazon icon pops up on my phone telling me there is an update waiting.  Also, I don't download updates as soon as they come out for ANYTHING and instead wait until I see how the reviews are for that update so I don't make a hasty mistake and can keep the old one if it's better or I'm waiting for a fix.  So, until that time, I am bombarded with reminders from Amazon on the main screen of my phone with NO ABILTIY TO TURN OFF THESE ANNOYING ALERTS. I already have this blue Amazon app on my phone, but I am very hesitant in even opening it until I find out whether this app ALSO has the INABILITY TO TURN OFF THE INCESSANT ALERTS.  I will just keep looking at reviews before I find a satisfactory answer.  I already emailed Amazon about the Appstore app problems (last major update to it was just 2 days ago), and they pretty much sent me a generic email saying "at this time, it's not a feature..." so I don't want to waste my time with Amazon again on asking about THIS app, and trust that other customers will give me the skinny on how this app functions.  As it stands now, the ratings are poor, but I really want to find out about how much they alert/contact you and whether Amazon let's you control these alerts.  Thank you.

I wanted to purchase The Matrix on Blue-ray and went into Best Buy to see if they had a copy.  They had it but it was waaay overpriced so I looked it up on the Amazon Mobile app and found it there for about fifteen dollars less.  I found a manager and showed him the price difference and he reduced the price of the Blue-ray so I ended up going home with it that day.That is probably not the story that Amazon wants people to hear, and I think it depends on the store manager you pick up, too, but that is the biggest use I've found for this app.I have used it for other things, too.  I love Amazon reviews, especially after how many I have written.  So when I see a product I've picked up this mobile app, brought up the item, and read the reviews right there in the store.  I love it!!  This Amazon will be happy to hear: I have seen it at such a good price I've purchased things while in the store and waited a couple of days for it to show up in the mail.You can do all of this from your Android browser of choice, but this mobile app is built with mobile technology in mind.  It is soooo much better than surfing with such small real-estate.  It is easy to navigate around and I have found it to be very informative while out shopping.I have no complaints as I've gotten a lot of use out of this free app.  Highly recommended, it should be on every Android.

This review is regarding to Amazon's Android Appstore app, which you need it to run Amazon Mobile. You may not know is that some of Amazon's daily free paid apps are also require Appstore app. If Appstore is uninstalled, you will be bombarded with warning message about how the apps can't run without Appstore every time the apps try to run in the background. It becomes nightmare when these apps try to run every hour, you'll end up getting these message every hour.The reason that I uninstall Appstore is because it's constantly running in the background doing something. Not only it's a privacy concern, it also slows down the phone and drains its battery.To Amazon App department, please follow Amazon Retail business model; which is offer excellent services and prices with no string attached. If you offer 3rd party paid apps for free, offer them as they are. Don't link them to Appstore app for data collecting purpose.

Everything you need is still there, it is just a little slower than using a real internet browser.

If I can, then I order it from Amazon right there on my phone in whatever store we're shopping at. Sometimes, the prices are better in store, so this app helps me feel like I'm getting the best deals on what I'm shopping for.  It's good to also check reviews on the fly to make sure I'm buing something worth my while.  This one is a must-have app.

I've had to force the program to stop and restart countless times. Now, Amazon thinks I have several hundred Android devices. And, because of that, I try to avoid using these apps if I can, although the Appstore app is required for several games to operate properly.

This app provides a reliable on-the-go access to Amazon's vast data base where you can find:  Amazon's pricing, customer's ratings, reviews, and product full description. Your searches are saved & synced with your Amazon Account. Sweet :-)The Mash Up:1) Clean & easy to navigate UI. Thumbs up on that.2)  Versatile search options:  customers can search any given product they may come across by Name, Barcode or Photo. Of course, to get to use photo search you'd have to go to' More' drop menu, scroll down to `Amazon Remembers' &  snap your photo from there. Results, at least for me, have been really impressive. But I won't be surprised if I heard there were some mismatches or off results. My only suggestion in regard to product searchability is to unify all three search options in the Search Box. That would make it more easily accessible. One click & you're in for what you need instead of digging up menus! Make sense, right?! Plus, it won't hurt to add SKU/ UPC search & more types of barcodes lookups.3) Also, I like the fact that you can check your `Wish' Lists. Odd enough, you won't see your `Shopping List' which I honestly don't see any use of this particular distinction?!! I'd suggest implementing Push notifications of price changes for items on your Wish Lists [ which I rather call Watch List] so that you never miss a chance to best spend your hard earned dimes'4)  You also can view & track you orders. This section needs to be improved. My only `beef `to this segment is that it doesn't offer the same info you'd expect to find logging into your account from your computer!5) I definitely would love to see Customers being able to send Price Feed on items in brick & mortar stores.  This will lit up price fights & may the best offer win!6) Now as far as performance, this app is well built. It never crashed on my Epic 4G (before nor after I got my Froyo update). It is stable, never crashed on my phone, loads up fast, & works like a champ!7) I'm sure to recommend this app to a friend. It's helped me make better buying choices. If you're an impulse buyer, you sure want to have this app on your smartphone to help you make `smarter' choices ;-)  I'd love to think that app developers actually read customers reviews & feedback on their app. Fingers crossed '

I would rather use my computer to place my order. Just feels safer.

I even impressed my boss while she was doing a supply order for our office and I told her she could get the item cheaper through Amazon (ink) and then pulled out my phone and showed her. Got a bonus for it!

For me, when ever I am out and about, and I may per chance find something I am looking for.  Well now, I just bring up my Amazon Mobile app, being as the app will work on 3/4G and/or WiFi, I'm never without my trusty Amazon Mobile app.  I can open open the app, log on, search for whatever it is I'm drooling over at the time, if I can get it cheaper on Amazon, and chances are I will, if it is something I absolutely have to have, I can order it on the spot, and have it in my hands in a matter of days.If you are on the go, or out and about, if you are anything at all like I am, and this goes for you guys, tools, yea Amazon has ALL kinds of tools, electronic gizmos and gadgets, which I'm a sucker for, Amazon has all kinds of electronics too.  Now you don't need to be on your home computer to satisfy those impulse purchases, or that late night gift for your wife or girlfriend.  You can do it all from the comfort of your smartphone.

It's ok for price comparing, but there are apps that do just that better. Lacks a lot of the convenience amazon is known for. Can't really just browse, which for an app, thats exactly what i'd actually want to do. As other guy mentioned, the permissions this app asks for, a little strange. With that and the overall experience this app feels more like bloatware, something that verizon would stick on a phone, than a clean app that makes my life easier. Lot of potential in a good amazon app, so I hope they put more time into this.

It works as expected, allowing me to search for and order items, and also to access my previous orders, wishlist, etc.  The user interface is considerably simplified compared to the full browser page version. That's appropriate because most Android devices, smartphones and tablets, have much less screen area to display info.  It's a free app, so there's no downside to trying it out. You may like it.

Using this app on our LG Ally, I quickly found the item on Amazon, ordered it, and sent it on its way to her house a thousand miles away. She had it 2 days later. We bought the original jar for her from Amazon, so it was easy to find again. Trying to do this on a laptop would have required a wifi link, but none was available. Great service from Amazon and an easy-to-use Android app from Amazon.

The app can't filter by price, by free shipping, by ratings.. I can see my order history and tracking, which is good, but there's no link to the items so I can reorder or write a review. Clicking on the &quot;full site&quot; link sorta works, except as soon as you click on a link, it reverts to mobile. I usually give up and don't end up buying what I was looking for, so I'm calling this app a failure.

I've had no problems using the app on my tablet. The only improvement I could suggest is a delete feature, for those daily free apps I tried but no longer want to keep. After deleting them from my tablet, the app notifies me they're available to upgrade/reinstall and won't let me purge the list of unwanted apps.

Previously we used the Google Play (Market). Amazon content is repeatedly weeks, or months, behind Google's similar content. Often, in-app purchases are broken between devices on Amazon - such as the Cranky update which works on my Fire, but not on my RAZR. Amazon's technical support is horrible, telling me to reformat my phone (which I did) but it didn't make any difference. Now, Amazon makes you buy the same content twice for Fire vs. other Android devices - like Angry Birds Space or Cut the Rope Experiments, locking out programs from certain devices. (Therefore you must buy it twice, often at a higher price.)Overall, a VERY dissatisfied Amazon customer. We can't merge accounts, share content, etc. (Have a different account that has Prime on it, but can't bring them together!) As nice as the Fire was to begin with, the Appstore is part of the experience, and these major failures and the inability to Enterprise manage our devices means I will not buy more nor recommend them to others.After investing in the Fire, since I can't get at the content I need, my next step is now to start exploring how to root and re-rom the device, so that rather than using the Appstore I can get applications elsewhere. I feel very much like you have STOLEN from me, Amazon. You are changing the terms of our agreement after I have bought in. That doesn't seem to bother you either. It is NOT your right.

The police/fire feed for the county where that 90% of my daily commuting occurs provides valuable early warning about incidents on roads that traffic reporters would be telling me about far too late...if at all.Easy to use; search by name, genre or location, or search for any audio within a radius near you.

Works better than my desk scanner, since the building I am in is not friendly to RF getting in, and with about half of the local services going digital, my analog scanner is deaf to them.  The sites I use on Scanner pro have digital receivers.  Well worth paying the premium price if you have wifi internet available

They are adding new locations at a good rate so if your local area scanner radio chatter is not heard, check back soon!

It delivers great adjustable Audio, A Favorite button, add from a huge list. All I had hoped for and more. A tap of the screen takes me instantly from full coverage of Chicago to areas of New York City to A County S.O. in Texas. If you live with anyone, use headphones and enjoy listening to calls about true crimes, true breathless chases after the bad guys, and the satisfaction of "In custody." Crime may not pay but this APP pays off big time. Where is a cop when you need one...Right here!

I only have one disappointment about it. I live out in the country and about 40 miles or so from our County Sheriffs Office and the county I live in is not listed. So, I have to set it for the large city that's about 30 miles away and not in the County in which I live. We have no local Police Department and our local volenteer volunteer fire department is not listed in it either.

Not only that it will scan police and emergency services where ever you are. just go to the browse menu and browse for service where ever you happen to be. I have this on all my phones and even my kindle fire HD. You can go to Wal-Mart or Radio Shack and buy a scanner for a hundred bucks but why would you spend the money when you can just download this scanner on your  internet device?

We live 2 blocks from the fire station &amp; becuse I'm nosy, it's perfect for finding out why the sirens are going off. This app uses internet streams that people broadcast to the internet, not the actual fire/police frequencies. The scanner is in real time though, because of the internet streaming you won't be able to get car to car, specific police or anything like that unless the person streaming that area is also streaming those frequencies. If you want that kinda stuff buy a real scanner, but if you just wanna know what's going on get this app. If you get the free version too you can stream 2 different frequencies. I scan the county &amp; city police with free version &amp; county fire/ambulance with pro version. This is the best app of this kind. I've tried them all. Great app!

I use the things one puts on the home screen to listen to both police and fire but I have to manually switch between the two. I wonder if we could choose our favorites and then have the app &#34;scan&#34; each of them? I know it must be possible, it's in the name, but I haven't figured out how it can be done. Also I worry that the source website counts on it's users to provide content and you know how fragile that can be. I mean people are fallible and at the most critical times they may just forget to turn on their home scanners. Then what do we do?

This is not the developer's fault.  I expected a lot more out of it.  It also needs to be louder.  It is hard to hear it unless the room around me is very quiet.

This device is SO much better than using my radio.  If I can't find something in my own area, I can listen into channels in so many other places where they are always busy.  I am very glad I got this item, and I recommend it to everyone else to pay the small price for some very good entertainment.

Cant believe how much information ive learned since I began listening to the scanner radio channels in my area. What Ive discovered that's really cool is:  You know those  times when you see CURRENT breaking news on CNN, or your local TV news station? Well, often times, you can pick up the police or fire radio channel in that particular area if the state, town or city is announced. You can then, possibly hear any new information way before anyone else or if, at all!If I could only have just10 apps, I would have to include Scanner Radio Pro!!

I have found that, at least for me, synergising more than one reminder/to do app works best to minimize forgetfulness. This is one that I find indispensable, although I think it is most useful when used in conjunction with another reminder app that addresses its function from a different perspective. Probably different folks will find different combinations to be best suited for their own individual needs. But you won't regret having this app as part of your "Stay Organized" collection.UPDATED REMARKS 2/18/2014:  My original review (above, unchanged) awarded this app 4 stars, and was a very positive review of the app. Quite a bit of time has passed since I posted the original review, and since I find myself continuing to use the app literally several times a day, it seems to me that it has demonstrated that it is worth a full five star rating. Apps come and apps go, and certainly there is an abundance of "reminder" apps and "to do list" apps. This one has shown itself to be well-designed, easy to use, and really actually very useful in "real life."All too many apps seem to exist merely because it was possible to create them. This app is a wonderful example of an app that will become almost indispensable after it has been used for a while.Enthusiastically recommended.

AFC9TTDR0SYS7,B004GLI2GS,0.444444444444,0.584090909091,0.044039483675,0.00151860288535,0.257,0.833333333333,TRUTHFUL,I gave this five stars because it does what it says it does but. . .If you can get past the learning curve for setup, this is a nice app.  I failed twice to set a reminder where the screen would light up from standby.  You have to go into the vibrate mode which allows for customization which is nice.  But I found the menu for lighting the display by accident.  Not that user friendly.  My big disappointment was that like all the other clock/calendar apps I've tried, you have to acknowledge the alarm or it keeps sounding.My old Motorola phone worked nicely for alarms.  I set it for 3:00 every day to take my meds.  It sounds for a couple of seconds and then snoozes on its own.  You don't have to take it out of your pocket and go through screens to snooze it.  It sounds again on its own every 10 minutes for up to an hour or until you press "OK".  If you're in a meeting or in the doctor's office, it is very unobtrusive and I can just ignore it until I finish my business instead of having to interrupt my meeting to mess with my phone.Edit:  I found a great alarm app that has AUTO SNOOZE!  You don't have to touch it if you don't want to deal with it immediately--it will snooze on its own.  Totally customizable too!  It's called ALARM CLOCK XTREME FREE.  You can pay to disable Net connection.  Great app.

The only thing I DON'T like about it is that if you want to jump more than one space at a time, you actually have to get permission from your opponent!  A box comes up asking if it's okay to jump more than once and if you hit no, then you can only jump once.  I don't think you should have to get permission on a game like this because you can use it against the other person, and the rules of the game are that you CAN jump more than once, period!  Other than that, it's a good game of checkers without the cats knocking the pieces all over the room!!

Overall I would definitely recommend this app to anyone looking or a good time and a sturdy checkers app on the go. There is also a free version of this app called checkers free which is basically the same, but if you enjoy this game frequently remember to support its creators who brought you the opportunity to enjoy it, you will also want the paid version if you detest advertisement which can get annoying and in the way of your game play. This publisher also offers an outstanding chess app if you like to play chess, it's called chess premium or chess free.

The controls are very simple and easy to use, and I like that it's not a joystick like other games. I move off joysticks and lose control, having a control point to touch around is very nice.The 'calibration' (moving the control point) is supposed to be long-pressing the control point for 3 seconds, but for me it seemed more like 5-6 seconds.The messages do pop-up quite frequently, so turning them off is a must (haven't done it yet, but noticed a review said you could). A better option would be text popping up along the top, not a box pausing the game every 5 seconds.Great game, love it, love the new control point control scheme, far easier to use than virtual joysticks.

But this game is the exception to that. Hexage has combined wonderful graphics with a classic game but with a new concept. You collect the little squares for points but get help along the way from a cute might I add old yellow square. Beware of the red squares because in this revamp there are more then four pesky little &quot;ghosts&quot;.

AC9APJ49AI2RY,B004GMP53U,0.837209302326,0.675,0.0,0.0,0.082,0.5,TRUTHFUL,the concept and style of the game are excellent. unfortunately that can not make up for two huge flaws. 1st the controls are awful. quick and precise control is need to succeed but the directional ring is not up to the task. if the control was more like a ball instead of a ring it would be much easier. the nonstop interruptions are incredible annoying. i don't need useless commentary every 30 seconds. with some tweaking this game would be great.

Looking at a lot of the reviews for "Evac", I have seen a surprising number of people criticize it, along with Hexage's other game "Radiant" (another attempt to reinvent a classic), for being a "rip-off" of an old game. I understand and see that this game does heavily get its influence from Pacman and directly get some of its gameplay from it, but Hexage does not simply copy the classic but rather breathes new life into it and titling it simply "Evac".Story & Basis -Unlike Pacman, "Evac" actually gives a storyline for why you are gobbling up colors (in this case), and does so through dialogue at the beginning of each of the 32 levels and even throughout the level. While the storyline is nothing to in-depth, I found the in-game dialogue to be annoying to an extent. You could be running away from an army of red squares and abruptly have dialogue come up because you triggered some in-game text. Luckily, "Evac" gives you an option to turn this off, and this can easily solve this particular problem. Also, you can click the bottom right of the screen to view dialogue that you may have missed at your own time and pace within the level. Nothing too spectacular, but I must say it adds a certain charm as you attempt to escape the villian: Shadowbox, who wants to drain you of your color and keep you within his realm.Graphics -Hexage's neon-based visual style that appears in every game of theirs makes another appearance here in the art style. The level design features structures with radiating neon-lights, and the "colors" that you pick up to complete the level feature neon colors also. The graphics are stunning, and on the Kindle Fire HD, the visuals alone make this game a great experience. Each of the 32 levels tend to feature different style and shades of the neon lights depending on the nature of what you are doing too.Music -"Evac" boasts Hexage's standard techno music, and the soundtrack in this game is rather mellow to fit the tone of the game. For me, the soundtrack was incredible to listen to and almost went hand-in-hand with the gameplay.Gameplay & Value -In "Evac", there is only one control: move. You have a virtual pad to move, and the controls are very responsive for making fast turns in all my experience. In playing the entire 32 levels of "Evac", I can't remember the controls ever be a problem, and they actually work very well. "Evac" also gives you option of moving the virtual pad to wherever you want on the screen by simply pressing and holding the virtual pad for a few seconds. In the 32 levels, many of them feature a special gimmick that you need to utilize to beat the level, including several power-ups (ranging from being able to pass through enemies to creating a sphere of spikes around you)and doors that you can open by pushing blocks on top of. This is where "Evac" is very unique: it's not simply monotony as each level requires you to think on top of being fast in movement. The leaderboards in "Evac" also encourage replay of the 32 levels in order to become better on the leaderboards, and this was very fun for me as I made it to 13 overall. The 32 levels may seem rather short, but many are long and I said earlier, there is plenty of replay value if you want to beat your score for each level.Conclusion -If you're a fan of Pacman or like arcade style games, I highly recommend picking "Evac" up. The music, gameplay, and design is great, and it a rather unique experience to play through.

While it is true that's not a very difficult accomplishment, what is true is that EVAC is ultimately a very addictive game with a great atmosphere and that really awesome graphical and story-telling style we've come to love from Hexage.

I have not played all levels yet but enjoyed what I have played. the breakaway talking is a bit much but can be turned off - radiant had the same chatter and I am used to it.

You get some neat powerups that let you destroy them (like the power pellets in Pac-Man) and there are some other puzzle-type elements.  However, after just a few levels you feel as if the game has run out of ideas and you're stuck just playing more difficult versions of the previous levels.  It also tries to present a &#34;story&#34; with quotes from certain other block characters but it all falls a little flat.

Hexage bucks the trends, comes up with very original games in the genres, and EVAC is no exception. It is a style all its own, the gameplay is well-thought out and original. I have enjoyed all the Hexage games I have played and they are all permanent apps on my smartphone. Another excellent game from Hexage.

But I do want to post a proper 1-star review to make up for the obvious developer reviews, which all have the same wording and a similarly poor grasp on spelling and grammar. And of course, we'll need to make up for the Brit who called everyone a &quot;twit.&quot; Isn't Hexage a British company? Hmm...Now, off to review their other app, which one of the shill reviews has graciously tipped us of too.

It has action, puzzle-solving, stealth, and humor.  It requires quick thinking and reflexes, tests your wits under pressure, and is a whole heck of a lot of fun to play.  The simplistic graphics are crisp and vibrant.  The controls, while not perfect, get the job done.  I did have a bit of trouble during the last couple of levels where pinpoint accuracy is required to successfully evade the onslaught of red blocks, but this was far from detracting enough to keep me from loving it.  I never expected to like this game so much, but it turned out to be a real treat.

I absolutely love the retro look with the hard-edged, pixelated characters but with the added blooming it knocks it out of the park. It doesn't hurt, of course, that the game itself is fun to play. It's like a cross between Pac-Man and its knock-offs (Lock 'n' Chase comes to mind).If anyone is annoyed with the touch screen controls, you can connect a Bluetooth keyboard and use either its directional arrow keys or the WASD keys to control the character.  :D

The game is a little more maze-like than Pac-Man and you have to think sometimes in order to solve certain puzzles. The graphics are decent but the sound got annoying in a hurry. Make sure to turn off that music! I did find this challenging enough to want to keep playing for a while.While it is pretty fun, but I found myself frustrated with the controls as I would try to be going a certain direction but my finger had slid too far away from the control area and I would stop moving altogether. Or fitting in some tighter spots can be a little difficult. I did get better with practice, but I kept getting frustrated by them.

A1X1CEGHTHMBL1,B004GMP53U,2.83720930233,0.403162907268,0.0207333461317,0.0,0.977,0,TRUTHFUL,Posted at 8:53 AMGame Play:The game is very similar to the old Pacman game even to the point where you have a thumb joystick to move your action figure to run the maze and collect the dots. For me unfortunately the joystick is on the LH side of the game and I am right handed so the game is played with my most uncoordinated hand. There is a pause button on the top of the LH side of the screen.The controls take time to get used to and it is difficult at best in an open room to move the character to where you want it to go. You will find that for precise movements you must tap the joystick on the side of the direction you want to move in and it will move in one space increments. It is difficult to try to move precisely while trying to clear the maze and have multiple enemies fluidly coming after you while you struggle to get one colored dot. You have slid your thumb off of the area of the control you want to use and you move in the wrong direction. On my Kindle Fire a calibration screen said it was going to pop up but it never did. I could never find the calibrations screen again.There are dialogs that pop up on the screen while you are playing and the stop the game while you have to read the messages either from the yellow box or the leader of the characters chasing you. I find this to be distracting and not needed and you can turn them off in the options menu.When you get to a certain point in some levels you are playing you will unlock the red squares that chase you. In some rooms there are yellow boxes that you can push in front of the doors so that they cannot enter the room to get you. In other levels you are immediately trapped and you can get stung by one or two of the squares before you can even move. There are open square boxes in the wall of the maze and you can go into one of them and hide and they cannot see you. You can also push the yellow boxes and crush the red squares chasing you. In some levels later in the game there are so many red squares after you that you have virtually nowhere to run.Home Screen:* Start* Scores - takes you to their leaderboard* Options - adjust music, sounds, dialogs off/on and vibrations off/on* About - links to the web and social networkso Visit us - didn't work, it could not find their website.o Follow us on Twittero Become our fan on Facebook.What I like:A remake of the old Pacman games brings back old memories of a fun game. Unfortunately the controls are difficult to use and can be frustrating to find the right touch. I got to be OK at the game after a while but the main limiting factor with the game is the awkwardness of the controls. You may be better at it that I am.What I dislike:The controls of the game on my Kindle Fire are nothing but frustrating to try to use. You are trying to use a joystick to move through a maze while being chased by multiple red squares that are moving with fluid motion while you are struggling to change directions or to pick up a colored dot. It is difficult to make fine adjustments in your position until you get a better feel for the controls. The dot that is the joystick does allow you to make single block steps but while you are trying to get it to work you are being pursued by multiple red squares trying to kill you. It is just awkward.I turned off the popup messages that occur in the middle of the game as I found them distracting and not of value to the game play.I don't like the access to Facebook, Twitter and to the internet to their website. Connections to Facebook allow you to sign in via Facebook so you can challenge and compete against your friends without ever leaving the game. You can invite your friends by posting a link to your Facebook wall. View a list of your Facebook friends who play EVAC HD. Compare your high scores with those of friends on your leaderboard. You can even share your in-game achievements on your wall.The access permissions to the internet are for social networks and for access to the developer's web site. It could have been easily left out as it is unnecessary for those options to be in the app for me.The original Pacman had better graphics and was a lot more fun to play than this game. To compare this game to a classic is an insult to Pacman. This is a cheap knock off with poor graphics and extremely bad controls. This is another example of a developer trying to make money by copying someone else's game concept.Summary:I didn't enjoy this game at all. The poor controls take away from any possibility of enjoying the game play. You are not able to move your character fast enough to evade the many enemies you are facing and you get overwhelmed. The maze also contains a lot of hallways with one box and with one dot in it that forces you to stop, change direction, get the dot, reverse, stop, and change direction, all while being pursued by killer squares.With the present control concept and performance this game is not worth $1.99 and it should be free all the time.Size: 13.54MB uncompressed on my Kindle Fire.Permissions:* Network communication - full internet access* Storage - modify/delete internal storage contents* Network control - view network state, view WIFI state* Hardware controls - control vibrator

The graphics are mediocre. The controls aren't great. But if you like pac man style games, you may like this, even though it pales compared to the original, and even some good knock offs I've tried.

Although this isn't my typical genre of game, the premise is promising. Unfortunately, the game is ruined by a tiny control pad in order to navigate around. Yes, you can move the joystick location by holding down it down, but my issue is with the size of it. It is simply just too small, so you're constantly pressing on the wrong direction or area. Fix this minor problem and this game would get five stars from me!

I get a little tired of everyone complaining about permissions all the time. If you want games on your phone, that's the name of the game. Some of the most fun games I have, are loaded with invasive permissions. I am not doing this to balance dev reviews, although I believe that is a shady practice by devs. This is an honest review. This game blows. Not even hd graphics like it suggests. Pac man is 2.99, go with that. I installed to see for myself, often reviews are inaccurate. I played the first level, and uninstalled before I got the email from amazon. Not worth the space it takes up.

I wont give any of the secrets away, but u can move stuff and trigger things and even get shockers that make the red squares(bad guys) freeze for a bit...( kind of like pac-man). There is only one thing I would change and that would be the controls. idk how I would improve them,but now they are abut hard and ive died a few times because of them. but besides that, this game is awesome!! #waybetterthanpac-man(;

The graphics is pretty cool and while the controls can be slightly frustrating at times but still not that bad at all. The onscreen joystick can be moved to any location of your choice (By default it comes on the left side) which makes it easier to play the game.The objective of the game is to consume all the dots on the screen while you are navigating through the maze and avoiding the ghostly looking characters. It does have similarities when compared to classic PACMAN game which we all love so much.The game has no hidden modules and permissions are fine. But if you hate social media integration into android games then yeah those modules are annoying.EVAC HD is a fine game to have if you love classic PACMAN game.

But I'm having a lot of problems with the controls. Not sure if I don't understand or it's just not responsive. Anyway if you're looking for this game, it's free everyday on Google Play. Seems like that happens with a lot of the free apps of the day from Amazon. I keep forgetting you Kindle people are stuck with the Amazon apps &amp; have no choices
A334SLFQ5WGVAM,B004GMP53U,0.162790697674,0.48078313253,0.0417098445596,0.000259067357513,0.675,0.8,TRUTHFUL,Namco has countless times tried to re-invent Pac-Man and put it back into mainstream gaming, failing horribly.Hexage Ltd has succeeded where (many) others couldn't. Don't let the games clever description fool you, this is simply an HD remake of Pac-Man, with more features and a somewhat decent escape story.The object of EVAC HD is to eat all the dots (colors) you can, while navigating through the maze and avoiding ghosts (other blocks) that try to capture (eat) you. If this sounds like a game you played ages ago, that's because it is; but re-skinned and re-imagined for this generation.I absolutely love all the changes they made here. Adding little spaces for you to hide and avoid ghosts (I am not calling them "reds" like the game does) was pure genius, and the power ups add even more strategy to the classic dot gobbling.Side Note:There is a lot of false information floating around about EVAC HD's control scheme.It greatly upsets me when people just randomly spew off made up facts about the product they review based on somebody else's summary. Trust me on this, there is nothing wrong with the controls and you CAN indeed move the joystick to suit your orientation.The Good:- Tight controls. Contrary to some other reviewers, I love the way controls are handled here. I feel they are very good and had no issues whatsoever on two phones and two tablets (INCLUDING the Kindle Fire).- Classic Pac-Man gameplay brings back warm feelings of nostalgia.- Ingenious power ups allow you to do everything from stunning to destroying your captors.- Minor puzzle elements (moving blocks to open doors, blocking off ghosts, etc) add a bit of strategy to the action.- Awesome graphics. I am a sucker for this type of HD-Retro look.- Excellent soundtrack and effects. My only complaint is that no classic Pac-Man tunes made it into the game, but I am guessing the developers simply didn't want to get sued.The Bad:- Social media integration. Really, can we stop it with this crap please? I don't want my device posting that I beat a level and advertise for any game.- Links from within the game allow you to access the Google Play and Amazon store (and purchase things from there).- NETWORK permissions in a SINGLE PLAYER GAME.Open network sockets gives this app free range internet access.Access information about networks allows it to do just that (for both your phone and wireless networks).These things are just not needed in a single player game and are here just for the social media and link aspects of the app.While there is no traffic going to and from the game while it is just being played, hitting some of the other links makes the network monitor light up like a Christmas tree (obviously).- The game is incredibly short. Adding another campaign would go a long way to justifying the higher price point.- Higher price point. The game retails at $1.99 but is NOT YET worth that price in its current state.The Ugly:Thankfully I found nothing too terrible in EVAC HD.Scores:The Game: 5/5Permissions: 2/5 (single player games DO NOT NEED network permissions).Score: 3.5/5, bumping it up to 4/5 because Amazon does not allow .5 ratings, and because I thoroughly enjoyed this game.Conclusion:I am a sucker for HD remakes of classic games, even more so if they are actually good (as is the case here). While I simply can't recommend the game at its $1.99 pricing point, I suggest you grab it as today's free download.If you enjoy classic games, give EVAC HD a try, and if they ever add another campaign (more levels), or drop the price to $.99, or remove the unnecessary network permissions - I would even recommend purchasing it.Good job to the developers for actually improving on a classic. You guys (and gals) did great work here, but some of the things I mentioned are preventing me from giving it a perfect rating. Fix them, and I will bump it up.

There are elements of this game that surpasses expectation. The controls are fine, and I was able to play with effective accuracy on my first tries.The game looks and feels great. Worth a good score. This game had been out for quite a while on the google play store. People there seem to navigate the controls just fine and downloaded by the THOUSANDS!! -(4 1/2 stars on google)-EVAC is a tried and true game, minimal permissions IMO and top 10 FAOTD for the year. Hexage is a top developer with good support. Not sure why Amazon users are hyper critical on FA'sOTD!With no IAP, reasonable permissions, decent controls and gorgeous retro style graphics. This game is worth is price! Ignore the cheepos that can't use there touch screens.Support this developer, they make great games with good support and is a mature company that innovates its products well.

It has a very abstract environment and it just makes me feel relaxed. But beware of the traps setup throughout the mazes many twists and turns I just wish there were more levels because I am hooked.

You'd have to click to dismiss it and meanwhile you were interrupted in the middle of escaping from the red guys, and when the box went away you'd have to quickly figure out where you are and what you were doing. I lost a lot of life points because of this. They should have the boss's taunts appear in an area separate from the maze so it doesn't interrupt the game.Otherwise the game was fun, and the power-ups were a nice addition to Pac-man.

Its addicting, and can be picked up or put down on the fly. Definitely worth a few dollars. The visuals are eye appealing, and the sounds not annoying, both of which are good. Just be careful of your device's limitations, as this IS the HD version. I play it on a Nexus 10.

Not a problem for more modern devices or those with memory to spare but smaller or slower units will suffer.Overall, not that terrible if you don't mind the ads and the forced internet connection (both of which I despise), but might require that you watch the memory usage.

The most recent version tries to predict what word I'm looking up, and it's nearly always wrong. Sometimes when typing in a word, it will display a drop-down menu with a list of possible words. My word will be in the list and I will click on it, but at least a third of the time, it doesn't know the word. How can the word be in your drop-down list, but you don't have a definition for it?

While it needs a data connection to retrieve the definitions, it is faster in my opinion than searching for the same thing through your phone's browser.

But while this app gives you the dictionary and thesaurus sections of their site, I need an app that I can move to the sd card. (Stupid Sprint-installed bloatware hogs up a lot of space. Dang it.)If they did that, and developed a paid, ad - free version, I would snap that up in a heartbeat.

Let me list all of the wonderful reasons to download this app.1. You can look up words (obviously).2. There is a daily word which you can view along with previous days &#34;daily words&#34;.3. The Hot word is so funny and interesting. I have not come across anything like it but it asks you a question such as &#34;How do you say &#34;basketball&#34; in Latin and what does it have to with the retiring people? and you can go back to previous days as well.4. A question of the day (which relates to grammar) such as  &#34;What is the difference between case in point and point in fact&#34;? Again you can go back to to previous days.5. There is also the Spanish word of the day  (also leads to previous days).6. There is a voice button that will read the word to you so you understand the proper way the word is to be spoken.7. There is a favorites section to &#34;bookmark&#34; yours to return to at a later date.8. There is a share button to which you can share to Facebook, Twitter, SMS, or email.9. They even have a place to leave feedback within the app and a way to rate it through the app as well.10. Lastly, there is a thesaurus section which mirrors all of the above features.The only option that did not work was the Voice feature where you can speak the word instead of typing it in but they already have a message up stating that it doesn't work with the new Kindles so I am betting that they are working on that now.In my book, it still deserves  5 stars. I would give it more if they allowed it. If you are a student, a writer, or someone who just loves to learn, then this app is for you.Regards,~ Holley Jacobs

While it does have a few features, not available on the website, none seem necessary to me.  As such, I feel it's a very good app, but not a good match for my personal needs - I've since uninstalled it, to free up resources.  However, for many other folks, it might indeed be very worthwhile.

I find the slideshows interesting because it's like getting a little bit of trivia/history of various things. Sometimes the slideshows say unavailable and the slideshows don't change too often so I keep seeing the same ones sometimes. There's a &#34;word of the day&#34; which you can actually listen to audio and hear the correct pronunciation of it which is nice. There's usually a section that talks about slang or current sayings which I find interesting because they usually try to go into great detail of where the word or saying originates from. It's a nice looking app that has a very sleek interface. I honestly don't notice that ads much they are only on the bottom of the screen and are quite small which is good.

It tends to be a little light on meanings and potentially relevant examples or use in context. I use it alot and enjoy the word of the day feature, but the word of the day doesn't update every day (not sure if it is an application hang-up or if the publisher doesn't update daily). It also has a great audio feature on how to pronounce the word (which is cool!). There are some other neat features and factoid tabs that offer an intellectual distraction from time to time. A very solid 4-star recommendation. As a freebie it is solid.

It Worked very well. I cannot remember any negative experiences using it in the past year on my phone.Then I got a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 a few months ago, and although there is a dictionary built in if you touch a word when reading a Kindle book to get the word's meaning which is wonderful and easy to use. But I still needed a stand alone dictionary app to use on my Kindle FIre HD. I use my Kindle as my library of reference books, as I am a writer and got tired long ago using heavy books while writing. I especially enjoy and use the Thesaurus quite a bit when I am writing.While playing the game, words with friends, there was a few instances where a word suggested by the game was not found in this dictionary app. Not a factor of my satisfaction, due to those words are usually obscure and rarely used in today's English language. Not a deal breaker for this FREE Dictionary.com app.I recommend this app. I am considering getting the paid version.This is a great app for my needs. Whether I use it on my phone or Kindle, it works so good. I can recommend it. I also put it onto my Grandkid's Kindle Fire HD to help them find the meaning of words easily. They are 6 and 8 and they have both learned to use it. The 8 yr old does very well. The 6yr old is still learning it. YAY!!

They like "blowing" the bubbles and the noise it makes when they pop.

And maybe change color so that the kids could learn colors. Maybe change colors so they could guess what comes next or pick a color for the bubbles to be.

I was surprised that the 3 yr old isn't interested in it & the 2 yr. old gets bored quickly. I actually have fun with it...hmmm...what does that mean? Anyway, some reviewers state that younger children have fun with it.You can make a big bubble by holding your finger on the screen, or several bubbles by touching & moving your finger around the screen. Tapping a bubble will break it. Just like real life some of the bubbles break on their own. Nice bubble sounds.It works fine on my Kindle Fire HD.

I haven't noticed any problems with this game, but I noticed this version is easier to win than the original game I installed.  Both games are good, I have noticed that numerous Apps that are listed as free for either games or other things are just as good if not better than the one that one has to pay to get.  Would recommend any of the Solitaire Games with 4 to 5 Star Rating that are free for the Kindle Fire HD.

Most other Solitaire apps are either very low graphic quality or paid app with too much excess stuff included.  This nice app has ads but they are on left side of screen where they do not bother at all on my Xoom tablet.  I got this app to replace a Solitaire App by &quot;Mobility&quot; that has now added some OBJECTIONABLE ADS for Dating sites, etc.  Luckily I found that  ODESYS has done a nice job with this app.

Most (but not all!) programs have Vegas scoring, but very few have visually appealing cards.  They are invariably, crude, fuzzy, or just plain unpleasant to look at.  Solitaire (Free) is one of two apps of the nearly dozen I've looked at that satisfy both of my criteria.  The other is Klondike Solitaire by Softick Ltd.  Unfortunately, Amazon system won't let me insert a link to the Amazon page for the other app, but you can find it by using Amazon's search feature.

After trying several other Solitaire (Klondike) apps on my tablet, this is the one I kept. I have enjoyed many hours playing this game. The runner-up was the app from MobilityWare, which is a very good game - but its ads were so intrusive that I had to get rid of it. The Ads in this game are tastefully off to the side, and do not intrude on my playing enjoyment. It is otherwise absolutely as good, or even better than the MobilityWare game. All it lacks is sound - and I don't really miss that. Bottom line - this is a 5 star keeper!

I can find tons of sliding block games, but what has the best options and interface and has gone the extra mile to make it a stellar game? Unfortunately this game just doesn't really do that for me.The good:-Simple: I like that the blocks are actually blocks, not cars or any other objects. Keeping it simple is more up my alley with these types of games.-Options: The option to change the background and block texture is nice.-Stats: The stats button is handy to see how you're doing on various levels.-Difficulty options: It's nice to have 6 different difficulty options to progress through. Novice is nice for grade schoolers since it's pretty basic and easy.-Size and permissions: So many games are now asking us for some crazy, unnecessary permissions, this game isn't (only a storage permission). I appreciate that. It's also a manageable size (7MB installed).The bad:-Scoring: My biggest annoyance with the game is how moves are scored.  I noticed after my first few games that the move counter seemed way off, so I paid attention the next game and realized that it doesn't actually count how many times you move, it counts how many moves you move a piece out of its starting spot. So if you start with a 1 x 1 block and using only one swipe you move it all the way across the board 4 spots, your move counter will go up to 4 instead of 1. The flip side of that is if you move it back to its original spot the move counter will read 0. Odd! I mean, you could get a really low score sometimes if you remembered where every piece started and tried to get it close to its original position after you have the red box piece piece close to its goal.-No level select/overview: My other smaller gripes are the game seems very choppy, not very fluid. There's no main level select screen where you can see a little icon or something of all the 112 levels in a set difficulty with your stats. It's hard to go back through and try to get a better score on a level because a little left and right arrow at the bottom are the only way to move through puzzles in a set difficulty. Levels can also be skipped, so then again it's hard to see what levels have been skipped and go back to them. I actually prefer gameplay that doesn't allow for unlimited skipping, maybe one or two levels, but not being able to skip through as many as you want.-Menus: The menus aren't very intuitive. It's very odd that in the "How to Play" section the screenshots show different menus and screens than what's in the game. I like the screenshots better.-Missing components: While I would never use the feature, and actually prefer it not included, the tutorial mentions a "heyzap" network that you're supposed to be prompted to log into after solving  a certain number of puzzles. I think it's weird that it's mentioned and not actually in the game. It makes it seem like the game was haphazardly put together and missing pieces. I would rather they just delete that mention in the tutorial and leave out all social networking extras.Overall, for a FAOTD it's not too bad. If it were an app I was going to fork out cash for I'd be a little annoyed and feel kind of ripped off.

I have played many different versions of this game for PC, and Android.. Almost all are identical .. the only thing the really changes is the graphics from game to game and the design. but the play is the same and the rules are the same as well. Fun and challenging game to kill some time. Not a game I would keep on my Tablet for to long only cuz it only has 112 levels and in a matter of 2 minutes I beat the first 10 already.. seems too easy but it's still a time killer. Fun game for kids to play to keep the distracted. 4 stars for the game only cuz it lacks change that sets it apart from the rest.

As an adult I realized that I was spatially challenged.  Puzzles like these are a good way for me to exercise my brain.

There's nothing uniquely special about this version (other than the price - I was able to pick it up when it was the free app of the day). It's your standard block moving game... rearrange the blocks to clear the puzzle and move onto the next. A great little game to pick up and tinker with for short periods of time while waiting for the train, bus, at the doctor's office, etc. This one is exactly what I expected it to be.

Do you think the average Amazon reviewer would type like that?Other than the fact that it's obviously derivative, the difference that makes this game worse than it should is that it keeps track of how many moves you make and judges you for them. That adds unnecessary pressure that a certain unamed game on the iPhone market (that will remain unnamed) does not have, and is a better game for it.

If you decide to try to beat your own previous score in a level this will become frustrating.

It looked like a neat game with decent permissions,  but when I tried it I discovered the screwy scoring that doesn't allow you to better your score.

It was a good game, I think I lost interest mainly because it was the same ole thing over and over again, just a little more challenging than the previous round...  It can keep me busy while I wait in line or at the doctors office though. :)

My 1 complaint (and reason for only giving 4 stars instead of 5) is the interface. There's no way to choose individual levels &amp; if there is I can't find it. The only thing you can choose is which difficulty mode you want to play. If you choose to replay a level it takes you to the previous level you had played. As far as I can see this is the only option to replay any level so if you want to try a level you had played 2 levels ago I think you're out of luck. I am really surprised this game is made like that because it seems like any game now has the levels menu set up just like angry birds anymore. This is extremely annoying to me. I think this would be a 5 star game when comparing it to another basic game of this type if there was a level menu! Btw, the developer reviews are just ridiculous and annoying. It's kind of an insult for them to think us so dense that we wouldn't be able to tell those reviews are written by the developer and are obviously all by the same person. Wow! It seems like all developers have their own language or something, like real users really talk like that lol

Scoring seemed off in that a single move would sometimes count as more than one.  There really needs to be a reset button you do not have to dig through menus to find.  Also the reset button does not work right if you have finished the level.  It puts all the bricks back but does not return the red brick.  Finally the controls seem to be off because when I drag a block all the way across the field, i find i have run out of screen before I get the block half way across which means more moves since i have to lift my finger.

A nice touch is that the hints give you the option of more help or to take it from there. I don't particularly care for how the moves are counted, but hey, that's minor stuff. It also could be considered an additional challenge.

Sound Effects are nice and Music is Pleasantly Soothing.  It gets to be a very challenging Slider Puzzle game after a short while but is still Fun to play.  I haven't seen any MAJOR problems on my Xoom Tablet.  It is a little BUGGY (as others have said) but the only glitch on my device so far is the Main Square Block that you need to move towards the target area actually DISAPPEARS sometimes.  I found a FIX for that though... Just press the arrow for next level and then press that back arrow.  This brings you back to your level with the Main Square Block RESTORED.  The Instructions are OK and the Menu and Settings features work fine.  I like that it only has 1 Permission for SD Card access. The only complaint I have is that when you EXIT THE APP through the MENU or pressing your BACK BUTTON 3 times, the app stays RUNNING IN BACKGROUND.  This uses Battery power needlessly and you have to use a Task Killer every time after you play to SHUT IT DOWN COMPLETELY.  Minus 1 Star for that annoyance and the Buggy features.

It features 112 puzzles in the game with six different levels of difficulty. The game play consists of moving the puzzle pieces around the board to allow you to move the red square to the spot where the red shaded area is on the board. The puzzle pieces are different shaped and different colors and the movements take some forethought and planning. It is a lot like moving furniture in my home.Changing difficulty adds more pieces and smaller pieces to the board and makes the game more challenging and fun.Main Screen:* Sound on* PlayPlay mode features:* Novice* Casual* Standard* Difficult* Advanced* Expert* How to play* Settings - change screen colors, Silent mode, SFX on, music on, hide status bar, screen transitions* Recommend to a friend takes you to your email or your preferred messaging application to send a message* The graph button keeps track of your statisticsWhat I like:I like puzzle games and this one is fun to play and challenging. The graphics are nicely done and I like the music in the background. This is a real interesting time waster while you have a few minutes to kill. It challenges your mind and it is entertaining at the same time.I played the game on a second generation Kindle and it had no issues.

If you are in the middle of the "novice" section as an example, and would like to move to a different challenging level, nothing really happens if you tap the "Menu" item on my 8.9" Kindle Fire.I picked this up for free as the free app of the day vs. it's normal price of $0.99 - for free, it's worth a shot, but save your buck once they start charging for it.

Good challlenge and easy play. Music is very relaxing as are the puzzles. There is no clock to beat in the &quot;normal/classic&quot; mode. There is a move counter so you can try to better yourself.

Seems almost too easy when you start but doesn't take too long before you have to really think about the moves to get that red square where it belongs. I have spent quite a bit of time with this one.

Graphics are simple but colorful. The music is very pleasant and not irritating. Game play may be a bit slow on certain touched, but overall not bad. The only thing I do not like is the fact that I think it might be almost impossible to make the target score. Every square you move to counts as one move. The movement of one piece should count as one no matter how far you move. Download and enjoy!

It made it more challenging and frustrating.  Could be good for some people though.
A18HE80910BTZI,B004GVUPFE,0.579710144928,0.289229024943,0.0163766632549,0.00409416581372,0.194,1.0,TRUTHFUL,It installed fine on my kindle fire I did like the simplicity of the game even though it is choppy at times when yo move. There are a lot of these types of games in the market as well as Amazon APP store which makes you move boxes and other objects to solve puzzles. This one does not really stand apart from anyone in terms of puzzle solving but I do like the simple interface and manageable small size app. There is no unwanted permissions and is worth the download if you like puzzles. The reason the rating falls on this game falls by one star is due to the way scoring is done. The game scoring system doesn't actually count how many times you move the blocks, it counts how many moves you move a piece out of its starting spot!!!! and counts less or more depending on where it ends up. This drove me nuts and I feel this needs to be fixed by the developer in the next update.For now, I am going to keep it in the cloud and wait for app update to try the game again later.

There are no penelties for going over the given moves to solve which allows you to try more puzzles.  It doesn't hold you back do my 6 yr old is happy after move 100 when he finally solves the harder ones but to be honest this only held his attention for three plays. I don't see myself playing it often but it is a nice game for those who enjoy these and to me was calming.Florida Mom

This is not Amazon's fault, however. The Kindle HD is a new tablet & many developers have either not tested or created their apps to work with it. But...this Move it! looks absolutely fantastic on Amazon's new line of HD Kindles! ( on both the 8.9" & the 7") With its crisp, clear graphics & vividly sharp colors combined with smooth game controls, I found this app to be not only eye pleasing but quite entertaining as well!Finally. A game I like & actually play on my 8.9"! :)There are 672 puzzles of varying degrees of difficulty from Novice to Expert. When you tap Menu , A small bar will appear at the very top of your screen where you can then can choose several options to change the background color & other settings.If you like casual strategy puzzles & especially if you own a new Kindle HD, I highly recommend downloading this game as today's FAOTD. And, since it has only minimal permissions, it's certainly worth the asking price.*Warning: VERY ADDICTIVE!! =)

AI Factory added a couple of new things to the game. New shapes that aren't squares or rectangles and pieces that must move together add to the typical challenge of moving things around, as well as a move counter and target # of moves to meet.  Those last two increase the replay potential, as you try to meet/beat the target.  If that weren't enough, there are several levels of difficulty to choose from.  The graphics are very well done, with some tastefully light music running the background.  Control is spot on, help section complete, and there is a full options section for adjusting the game visuals and audio to your liking.  High scores/trophies are tracked locally, though you can go global with the HeyZap (requires install).  AI Factory plugged in pretty much every feature one could want in game, right down to the price - free.I hope you found this review helpful.  If not, feel free to leave comments/questions.

It appears to be the game that drops puzzle pieces from above that must be moved as they drop to create a row. But that's not how this game works.

Is a clever variation of the old plastic sliding block puzzles that I loved to play as a kid. With those puzzles, you typically had a 4 x 4 grid with all but one of the squares filled with blocks that had some design or number on them; the goal was to rearrange the blocks to meet a certain end configuration. In Move it! the goal is to move the large red block into the shaded target square.There are six levels: novice, casual, standard, difficult, advanced, and expert, with a total of 150 puzzles. There's also a short tutorial. You can toggle the music and sound effects on or off, but I liked the simple guitar music if the volume was turned down a bit.The mechanics of the game are very simple to learn, but winning gets progressively more difficult as you advance. Mercifully, there's an undo button that will undo as many moves as you want to take back. Holding the button down for a second will reset the puzzle. If you're hopelessly stuck, from the menu bar at the bottom of the screen, press "View Solution," and you can see a move-by-move solution.I enjoyed solving (or trying to solve) the puzzles. They get pretty challenging after the first few, but it's a great exercise in analyzing and solving spatial relations.I played Move it! on my Kindle Fire, and it installed and ran perfectly. Interestingly, this is one of the few apps that I've seen that runs well in both portrait and landscape orientation.

I was thrown a tough one. I was not so cocky any more! The puzzlesin this game are good strategy builders. The target number of moves seems easy at first,until you realize that each move is scored by the smallest square on the board. So far,I have only done one puzzle that I came even close to matching the target number of moves.That, however, will not deter me from trying to beat it!!

It is not as powerful as the PC version but has the basics needed.  You have to do a manual password paste to use it for logins.  The PC version has an automatic feature.

It puts 2 ongoing notifications in your notification bar. So suppose you open your bank app, which resets when you goto another app. You pull down the notification bar, click the username notification and paste it into your bank app; repeat for the password. Ultra convenient.Plus, the passwords are encrypted multiple times (as many times as you specify), and the password file just saves on your SD card - if your phone kills over, you still have your passwords on your card.Finally, the organization is simple and easy to use: make categories and group the types of data together.GET THIS APP!

I looked at this for my droid phone because I could not get 1Password to sync with my Mac. I did find some online help and solved the problem. I returned back to 1Password after solving my problem. You should still look at this program you may have a different opinion than me.

I had the BlackBerry version on my BB, and have the PC version on my computer. The great thing is that the same database can be shared across all platforms. With the database added into my Dropbox, passwords on my Samsung Galaxy S are also on my PC (and BlackBerry), and get updated on all devices just by saving the database (I do open the Dropbox app on my SGS and open the database instead of opening the app with the icon, just to make sure I have the most up-to-date data).When selecting an item, the username and password are added to the notification bar, making it easy to copy/paste into websites and apps. It also has a random password generator, so you can make sure all of your passwords are different. I don't even know what half of my passwords are anymore, since they are all generated through this app. All I have to do is load up KeePass, then copy/paste passwords to use them. I feel like my passwords are much more secure now.

Unfortunately, it has no Android app.  If I could find a way to import my Roboform passwords, I would like it a lot better.  The thought of having to add 100s of them into a new data base is daunting.  I'm not sure if the resulting KeePass Droid data base is encrypted or not.  Wi-Fi is so vulnerable.

I entered most of my passwords using the desktop version (free and available for Windows, Mac, and Linux). I then download the password file to my phone or the Kindle Fire and access the passwords with this app.Although the Dropbox app isn't available through the Amazon app market, you can get it for the Kindle Fire by going to Settings (the gear icon at the top) and grant permission to install apps from unknown sources. Then navigate your web browser to the Dropbox site and download it from there.Once Dropbox is installed you have to navigate to the password file within the Dropbox app and download it to your mobile device. Then open KeePassDroid, go to its settings and enter the path to your local copy of the password file as the default file. If you've installed a file manager on your mobile device you can also open your password file by long pressing on the file name within the file manager and selecting open from the context menu.One thing to watch out for: if you modify the password file on your computer, you have to explicitly tell the Android Dropbox app to download the file again from the cloud. The Dropbox app won't sync files automatically. Same thing is true if you modify the password file on your mobile device. You have to explicitly tell the Dropnox app to upload the new password file to the cloud.

Free, open source, and with a number of strong security measures, I've used it for several years now. And KeePassDroid brings the brilliance of the program to your Android device. In this day and age, one of the worst mistakes people make is to use the same username and password on multiple web sites. If your account is compromised on one site, it can then spread to all the other sites where you use the same password. KeePass makes it easy to create and use strong and unique passwords.I've seen comments about this program being hard to use and don't really know what to say. It's easy - in KeePass, you enter the site name, URL, and the username and password you want to use for that site. Next time you go to the site, open KeePassDroid, pick the site, and copy the password to the clipboard. Then enter your username on the site and paste in the password. Simple.KeePass can also generate passwords for you based on various lengths and character types if you want. Entries can be grouped logically (like Home Banking, Email, et cetera). Need more information? Go to the app's official site (keepass.info) and click on the First Steps Tutorial. There's plenty more information there, you can get as much or as little info as you'd like.

I was one of those people that smarter people shook their heads at sadly because I had one password I used for everything. The more I read about identity theft and compromised info, the more I got that I needed to be more responsible, and I'm not a tech genius, and my memory is 59 years old now.  I can remember a phone number from when I was 13 years old.  I can barely remember your name.  So I started writing passwords down in a little notebook which I kept in a drawer by the computer.  Yes, the smart people shook their heads again.  This is better.  I remember one password, and there are all my passwords in one place, in a searchable database.  It's easy to use.  I have Keepass on my desktop, and once a month I try to remember to export the database so that I have the newest passwords for all those websites and so forth, and I drag a copy of that to Dropbox.  Then from my app on my smartphone, I can open that database file and voila! there are all my passwords wherever I am.  Genius.

All the letters are big enough to touch, but small enough so they don't crowd too much of the screen. There's a two player mode, too.Shorter words are often extremely difficult. I've been dealt a large quantity of three-letter words and even a couple of two-letter words. When you only have a handful of chances, they're a bit tough to solve, since you can't piece together much from the surrounding letters. An option to limit how short words can be would be nice.Overall, if you want to play hangman on your Android phone, this will do that very well.

Entire alphabet shows at bottom, with correct guesses turning letters green and incorrect turning red.  One of few free games with 2-person play on a single device.  With versions available on different platforms (both Android and iPad, for example), the game is as familiar in this digital format as the original.  Cons:  In single-player mode, the application's pre-generated puzzles on the easiest level are not always in the vocabulary of very young children (or some adults, even), but personally I see the potential vocabulary-enriching and conversation-provoking tendencies of the game as a Pro.  Puzzles are limited to a single word of up to 10 letters.  Incorrect guesses ae limited to 7, with no opportunity to add a  face or shoes for super tough puzzles.  Again, though, some may view  the simplicity inherent in those last Cons as a Pro.  Tips:  Tell children,  &quot;The answer may be a word you don't know, so I'm excited to see what new thing we might learn about today.&quot;  If you're playing 2-person, agree that a letter such as &quot;x&quot; will be a word-divider.  Then choose that letter first after entering the puzzle before handing it over to your opponent to solve.  For example, you might enter ixlovexyou.  You might also agree to use texting shorthand or phonetic spelling to ovecome the length limit (ex. luvxuxmost, sloxdancin).  For extra tough puzzles, fill in letters or  give hints.

It is nice to be able to play the game against the computer, because then you don't have to admit to anyone else that you like to play hangman. ;)However, I HATE the font. It's hard to read some of the letters. For example, the "O" looks like a diamond that has been hollowed out, and it has four sides. I suppose it is supposed to look like someone chiseled the words out of a rock tablet, but it doesn't, and it's just annoying. When you're using letters to guess a missing word, and you have to keep remembering what the letter you're looking at represents, that's a drawback. With a better font, this game would have rated five stars.

I recently got a Kindle and was excited to see it on it. now his big fingers will cause less troubles with us taking turns. I love playing this with him because we just cuddle in bed and write random words and it helps us bond. I wish there was a way to make a sentence though. So I could make him guess things like. &quot;I love you&quot; or &quot;I just farted&quot;

I love it but the only downside is that when you play single player your playing with the computer and the computer gives you words that you don't even know. Like krill like seriously 5 years old play this there not going to know what that is. And the computer  is hard to beat it like wins every time. I highly recommend this game to people who love hangman and want their kids to enjoy. But if you let your child use this game don't let them play single it's t ok hard. Play with them and go easy on them their little. Really get thus game it's so fun!!!!!

Please Amazon, the Trulia app WORKS so let me have it back!!

It seems with the real estate downfall, no one knows the true value of their home these days.  And if you are trying to buy or sell, people go to Zillow to see what they value the property.  I think we should go back to what appraisers think the property is worth, because realtors do not know any more.  They and the banks are the ones who got us into this trouble, only my opinion.

Zillow hit a home run with this app.  It is fast, accurate, and extremely user-friendly.  I recently updated it and have had no hang-ups or issues with the program.

It does not come with any detail instructions or help menu on how to use, but most of it is self-apparent.. Much detail information about the house being looked at can be seen by scrolling down the pop-up window that opens when a home in the map is clicked-on.  I did find-out by hapenstance that when a home for sale has associated pictures in this pop-up, they can be viewed full-screen by clicking (just once) on one of them.Unfortunately, when I checked my neighborhood for housing activity I was surprised to find that one home that sold recently, and another that has been on the market for a few weeks now were not identified as such (and yes I preset the Zillow filter to include homes for sale and those recently sold).

If you are looking for current houses on the market then this is not very good software.

Every real estate agent says NO NO NO  don't use this let me get your info, but in my experience this gives me comps, five years worth of taxes and graphs to show what the house and surroundings are doing, past and present sales.  Also what the list prices on the houses and what Zillow thinks they are should be selling for.  Most times the houses sell closer to Zillow estimates that what they agents listed the houses for. Great App

Using this app gives me a chance to see what the price ranges are for other homes in the area(s) I'm visiting or planning to visit.  It has saved me a load of travel time and driving time, not to mention gasoline. Using Zillow I'm able to figure what price range I want to bid on too.

You can customize searches for just about anything you want.  You can get market history on any property whether it's currently on the market or not.  It provides you with satellite maps of properties.  It gives you a graphical representation of the value of a piece of real estate over time.  You can filter property by for sale, for rent, recently sold or &#34;make me move&#34; (where you specify your criteria).  You can choose real estate types of single family, condo/apt, multi family, manufactured, lots/land.  You can save searches.  You can make notes on a property.  you can share on facebook or via email.  You can also search for a particular address if you want to find out about your own home or get nosy about your neighbors' homes.  If you're thinking about buying or renting or doing some real estate investment, this really should be a tool in your toolbox.  Even if you're just looking to keep up on what the market is doing, this is the real estate app for you.

We used it before contacting our agent so that we could have a better idea of what we wanted and what was available in our area. The stated market value is definitely a guess. People who take it seriously deserve to be disappointed. The photos are very helpful and the map is awesome.

It installed and runs fine on my Kindle Fire. I'm not planning to move anytime soon, so I don't really NEED Zillow, but it's one of the most interesting apps I've seen, so I WANT it. Let's face it, it's fun to look up friends' and relatives' homes and see what they're worth. Call it anonymous snooping!Zillow keeps getting better and better, with its filters, graphs of value over the years, and actual photos of many houses. The Kindle Fire has a big enough screen size that it's easy to view properties from a Google Earth view on one side and a Charts and Data view on the other side.A very useful app and one that could be extremely valuable for anyone planning to buy or sell a property.

Typical &#34;Zestimate&#34; prices are tied to accessed valuation, not to the potential sales price.  Price swings of $3 to $5k in a few days are crazy.  In my neighborhood, where houses are selling at or above asking price and are listed for only a couple of weeks before selling, Zillow estimates sale price up to $40,000 less than actual.  Sales ranges with a spread of $50 to $60k don't make any sense at all.  In new developments where new home prices are pretty much cast in stone, Zillow has &#34;Zestimate&#34; of up to $100k less!  My house, just as an example, has an appraised sale value of $289,900.  Zillow estimates the sales price to be $232,000.  My tax appraised value is $256,500. Go figure?  Don't count on this app to give you anything accurate.

Sadly, information on homes that I am familiar with were inaccurate; i.e. 3 bedroom home listed as 2, 2.5 bath listed as 1, etc. This renders the app useless as it is impossible to tell if info is correct or not on any given property.

First, it is easy to use, either search using your current location or type in a zip code. Second, it is easy to navigate. Once you have your location, just click on the houses in your price range to see what they have to offer. Third, once you have your houses saved in the app, you can look at those listings online as well.

Their Zestimate feature is helpful but a lot of realtors say that they are not true value, which I agree, and you will have to adjust the value if it is your own home by adding the type of improvements that you have made to your property.

I like this app because you can customize your search to only show the places you want to see. For an example you can set it to have a house built in the 2000s that is at least 1,500 sq ft that's less than $500,000. You can look at pictures of the place if they are any posted. You can make the pictures full screen or simply keep it small to quickly look through them. You can sign up to actually have an account or connect with Facebook as well to save favorites or to share with family and friends. I haven't had any problems with this app.

The date calculator is no doubt the most useful part of the app.  It can calculate the number of days or business days between two dates, or the date a certain number of days before or after a date.  There are a few instances where knowing the week number is important, but that functionality is built into the default Android calender.  The events list is useful, if you haven't already entered holidays into the Android calender.Less useful, but fun trivia nonetheless, is the "About a date" feature, that lets find all kinds of nifty information (On today's date in 1869, the Golden Spike was driven in Promontory Summit, Utah, completing the Transcontinental Railroad; Fred Astaire was born today in 1899, and Paul Revere died today in 1818), though all this app does is point your browser to the appropriate Wikipedia page.  There is also a list of months with a Friday the 13th, though again, you could just look at any calendar.This app includes 6 widgets, but the names aren't as obvious as they could be.  They are scattered all over the place as "Current date", "Day of year", "Events" and "Events list", and two for "Week Info".  The widgets are rather bland in appearance, and I'm not sure why Events needs to be 4 spaces wide, when a smaller widget would be more space efficient.There doesn't appear to be any way to enter events that repeat more often than annually, nor is there any way to add events that repeat on an unusual schedule (e.g., first Monday of September).The app comes with national holidays for a rather eclectic collection of 7 countries, including Norway, Switzerland, Austria and Singapore, but no support for Japan, Australia, the UK, Canada or Mexico.  I'd like to see a LOT more national holidays added (today is Mother's Day in Mexico and Constitution Day in Micronesia).  You can disable the holidays for any countries you don't care about.  You can also choose between Western or Orthodox Easter (or neither), though you can't have both, nor can you have both American and Canadian Thanksgiving.  There is no option for hiding religious holidays (e.g., Assumption of Mary).If the developer improves repeating events, and maybe adds a lot more countries to the events list, this app might be worth the 99 cents, but I'd hold off buying it until then.  Maybe next Bastille Day.

Someone below said they received a pop-up ad before they even finished checking out (i don't know what that means since it doesn't install until after you check out), I too received an ad right after downloading it, before I even opened it.for the first time. I saw something I didn't recognize in my drawer, so I pulled it down & tapped it to see what it was, it then tried opening a browser, but I wouldn't let it.I'm curious if this happens to others. If this happens to anyone else please post it in your review, I will check back.I will give it one more chance, if no other ads pop up, I'll keep it, but I'm very leery of it right now. I've had this android phone for over a year now and this is the first time this had happened.OK, I'm updating this a couple of hours later. I just picked up my phone to check a text and saw that another ad popped up.  So I never even opened/used this app.  I removed it.  Two pop-up ads within the first few hours of having it installed, without ever using it is too much for me.  If it ends up the ads were coming from someplace else, I'll edit this.I had trouble finding this app to remove it, I think I got it, instead of being called "TKWeek" it was called "Week" in Manage Apps.

This app on my Kindle Fire shows all the holidays that I can think of and I can't find any missing.  It is a great little app for calculating the number of days between two dates and has enough other features to help with other date related information (find a week number of a date or vice versa, learn about a specific date, add or subtract from a specific date, show events for a date, or show upcoming Friday the 13th dates for the superstitious crowd.At 345K on the Kinddle Fire it is not a space hog in the least.  Overall, I would have given this a 4 out of 5 just because it is so specific an app, but I disagree with many of the low ratings for this app so I've given it a 5 to offset some of the undeserved bad press.

My existing calendar on my computer adds in the American holidays or I can select which ethnic or country holidays I want to show including multiple selections.  This would have been a nice feature for this program.  In addition I have already programmed in the birthdays of my family and friends so I don't need to share my contact data.If you want more information about a holiday or a date this app simply links you to the Wikipedia web site that I could have gone to without this app.  There are multiple sites that will provide the history of a date as well as a list of local upcoming events you might like to attend.  If I have a WIFI to reach Wikipedia then I have one to go to a better site.  If you only going to provide a link to a web site like Wikipedia then you should allow the user to add in the web address of the site they would rather visit.Why do I care which months have Friday the 13th ?  You left out 12 holidays or events that American's recognize including Christmas but you count the days on the year that are on Friday the 13TH?  Overall I found that while this app seems to somewhat work, the data that I get from it is incomplete and/or linked to another site.  You should also list the following American events:* Flag Day June 14th* Father's Day June 17th* Labor Day September 3rd* Columbus Day October 8th* Election Day November 6th* Veteran's day November 11th* Christmas December 25th* Martin Luther King Day* Ground Hog Day February* Lincoln's Birthday  February 12* President's Day February* St Patrick's Day MarchHow could you forget Christmas?  1 Star!

Although there ate not to many uses for this type of app, when the do arrive it is nice to have an easy to use app to provide these answers.I do feel the need to take away some points for the number of bugs this app has.1. The date calculator has no way to trigger the update of the target date after you enter values into the day/week/month/year fields.  Instead I am forced to toggle the +/- buttons in order to get it to calculate.2. A design flaw with the date calculator is that once you enter values in the fields the labels (in the fields) disappear. So there is no visual clue on which box is for which field.3. Several of the apps pages do not provide a wide enough scroll wheel for the day portion of the date selector.  This results in a display of 10 1's and 10 2's since the first digit is all that gets displayed.So although these bugs are annoying, they either occur on parts that I won't use much anyway or have an easy enough work around.UPDATED 6/11/2012With exception of the the second issue I reported (not being able to see what entry fields are for what value once you enter something) the other issues have been resolved.The +/- buttons trigger the app to recalculate and it doesn't require toggling as I previously mentioned.The date selector is now using a cleaner interface to scroll through the date pieces and it works consistently now.Given those adjustments,  and the fact the the developer took time to read, reply and react to reviews like this makes me change the rating from 4 to 5 stars.

How can this app steal contact data when it doesn't have network permission? Access to contact data is required to add birthdays, anniversaries, or appointments. It's a shame that ignorance and anger is leading to fewer developers submitting good apps for FAotD. Amazon app reviews are rife with ignorant trolls who have inflated egos, an unwarranted sense of entitlement, and who aren't half as smart as their smart-phones.This app works great for its intended purpose. It's a handy adjunct to my Google Calendar.

If you're a Connect Four buff, this will disappoint, but for everyone else it won't matter.Otherwise this app works as advertised and is fun.A few other points:-It has ads-Sometimes the sound control doesn't work and you have to go to options instead of using volume buttons

Available for Android, PC, Mac, and iOS - though it isn't cheap and it really doesn't need to be expensive for what you get. I am a software developer and have worked with encryption quite a bit myself. The work that went into this app doesn't warrant charging 10 bucks for every platform you use it on. I wish they had a buy it once and use it anywhere policy as at 10 bucks, that would be more than fair.

For example, I decided to try it & the first thing I did was put in a login/password combo. Well, when I entered my password, it didn't show a blank suggestion bar on my keyboard. It showed my whole password right there for my phone to remember! (Yikes!!) So I haven't used itsince, because I don't trust it to keep my passwords safe.

Prior to buying it, I did my homework and found this app to be the closest to what I needed in a password security app. Is it possible that there are other apps out there that other people will find more compatible with their individual needs? Sure.. ..why not? Does that mean that this app then deserves a 1 star rating? Not at all.I've been checking the daily free app offered by Amazon since they started this service and I've been reading the reviews that each daily free app gets from the general populous and I'm dismayed. Let's skip past the "balk at a free lunch" idiocy and move on to the "reasonable expectation" aspect. I see people giving 1 star reviews for all the wrong reasons. I really don't think people understand the purpose of a rating system. If you are scanning through the reviews, please be mindful of what is a genuine review of the app and what is drivel.I'm not going to turn this into a comprehensive study on how the many people are mindless so I'll just end with a simple statement on the quality of mSecure - Password Manager based experiences from someone that has actually used the program extensively.mSecure - Password Manager is an excellent application for helping you maintain all of your passwords and texts. I use it on my Asus Transformer and have had nothing but good experiences with it. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a way to keep sensitive information secure and private.

I downloaded it, and am in the process of retreiving all of my passwords one by one to enter in to this app.This app has many customizable categories, many of which I will never use. So, I just delete the entire category. This app is EXTREMELY customizable.I really don't see what there is to dislike about this very useful app.

Just review the app on the merits of its capabilities, people, and don't knock an app down because it does the same thing something else does.That said, I recommend this for a lot of the people I work with.  It blows my mind how many people have one password for everything from their domain login to bank account access.  If one sight gets hacked, these people are going to be in a lot of trouble.This app is great because it is stored on your phone, which most people (especially myself) have everywhere and is easier to grab then information in a dropbox account.I do think the $5 is a little steep, or at a minimum include the ability to perform a desktop sync (that costs extra).  I also wish the app would lock itself whenever you exit because if you forget to lock it and somebody steals your phone then they will have access to all your passwords... and a way to export them quickly... until you figure it out and remotely kill your phone.

I am fairly sure it's safe, and I understand why it is asking for them, but I cannot condone using any app which holds sensitive data to request any permission allowing network access and things which 'could' be used maliciously.Cool features, but not going to use anything but the generator.

I was thrilled when Amazon offered it as a FAOTD!  I was able to easily synch with my existing account using DropBox, so no I have access to this information no matter where I am!  I prefer the computer version (keyboard is easier to use than the little one on the phone) for data entry, but it is nice to have access when I need it.  The program is essentially a database with many different configurations for storing the information.  I now use it as my address book, keep track of accounts and most importantly the various passwords required for all the different sites.  All this stuff is heavily encrypted and password protected, so I feel safe using it.

So far this has been a great place to store user names and other sensitive information.  It is itself password protected.  Biggest annoyance is it nags you to review it.  There is a way to dismiss it but I like this so much I kept it on till I finally got around to reviewing it.  Great app

The interface is relatively clean, and it's very configurable - it doesn't lock you into some developer's idea of which and how many fields each entry should have.  It uses higher-level encryption than any other program I've looked at, and it syncs with your desktop - something only one or two other apps do.  It's also relatively inexpensive with a one-time purchase fee instead of an annual subscription.That would all be great if it weren't for some pretty inexcusable drawbacks.  First, you can export your password list in order to move it to another device, but inexplicably the program exports to a completely unprotected .csv file!  It's not even an option, there's just no way to encrypt the exported file.  How you can develop a program that is designed to encrypt and protect data, then force users to export that data into a clear-text file is just beyond me.  Even worse is the fact that you can only connect to and sync data between your phone and computer if you install Apple's Bonjour service.  Are you kidding me?  This is what makes the app nothing but a bad iPhone port.  Hey guys - I bought an Android phone for a reason!  If I wanted to have to install Apple software on my computer I would have bought an iPhone!Bottom line is, no thanks. Don't force me to expose my password data if I need to export it, and don't force me to install Apple software to connect to an Android phone.  What a shame.

You have to be able to integrate wth an array of third party software, implement effective encryption, and sync easily between devices, all while showing your users you can be trusted.  It's no wonder so many are proprietary software or even monthly fees.It's a shame, then, that mSecure barely even makes an effort. It'll prefill your login forms on any browser... well, no, actually, just the stock one: no Miren, Dolphin or Firefox support here. It'll sync to your PC... if you buy additional software, which doesn't run on anything that's not Microsoft or Apple. It'll export your data for backup... in completely unencrypted form.  You have to take their word for it that they're keeping your data secure and not abusing it, because mSecure is proprietary software.The app is free today, but even today there are many better free options whose security and interoperability are better and easily verifiable by technical users. But even a GPG-encrypted text file is a better option for me than mSecure.

I use this app everyday on my PC - I like the security of having a backup on my tablet devices. At best I can say that it's a very stable app and the sync works perfectly. At worst the Android app is way overpriced for what little value it offers. However, it's GUI is underwhelming and setting up a new type requires each and every field to be set up manually - not even a default 10 field setup or ability to copy from another form. Changing the type can result in lost fields. The copy/paste to feature is a bit wonky - but it's probably the fault of Windows or the FireFox browser.

While you may think to yourself that this has a maze section in it and that precludes all other sections from being mazes, that simply isn't the case. They are all mazes. Some mazes are a mine field of holes you have to negotiate around. Some mazes have multiple trickery objectives you can't access. Some mazes have plausible almost solutions. Don't be fooled! There is only one solution to each of these maps.If you are not good at judging the difference between one small gap and another, this is not the game for you. If you hate having to back out to start over because the ball is such in a made trap, this game is not for you. If you have hands that are in any way unsteady when you get nervous/angry/frustrated, this game will be hard for you.

The graphics adjust while you are playing to show the angle; they seem a bit jumpy, but you can turn them off in the settings too (show board movement). Also includes sensitivity levels which I didn't touch. There's even a 2D option which I didn't try or need. Nice implementation with enough options to make it work for different devices with various default settings.

The graphics are quite mediocre. The ball seemed to want to catch and get hung up on everything. Many of the mazes have openings that are just a wee bit too small to get the ball through, so you have to figure out the proper path in addition to avoiding the pitfalls. Most annoying however are the moving sections, which can make the difference between finishing in a few seconds and taking a minute or more to finish.The app also has OpenFeint, for those of you who don't like being spied on.I think $4 is far too much for this game. $2 would be a more reasonable price, if it were a bit more polished. In its current state, 99 cents would be appropriate.Works on the Evo 3D and the Xoom.

I have to agree with the others about the price for the game, it would probably receive a much better response if it were a .99 cents app. No problems with the tilt sensing and whatnot on the HTC Evo. I have played all of three levels and know I will probably get into it, reminds me of the similar app on the iPhone.

The 3D is a little misleading because 3D cell phones are coming out and this does not take advantage of that feature.  It is only 3D in that it moves around several dimensions and isn't flat.The game is pretty responsive and I didn't notice any lag.  The challenges are some of the better ones I've seen.

It's just like the mazes I played as a kid, where you had to move a metal ball through a maze to reach a hole. There was little replay value with those, however, since once you mastered it, it was the same thing over and over. With 3D Labyrinth, there are a lot of different mazes (they call them maps) with varying degrees of difficulty. The balls roll very accurately when you tilt the Kindle Fire, and the sound effects and graphics are quite good. Winning isn't just a matter of getting the ball in the hole - the game records your times, so you could compete against friends to have the lowest elapsed time.Some of the mazes are really clever-and tough-with moving flippers and other shapes that can hinder you or help you, depending on how you play them.The game uses OpenFeint to compare scores, but you're not forced to register with OpenFeint if you don't want to.

I have tried a few personal finance Android apps and really think that Easy Money is potentially the best app of this type on the market. However it's completely unusable in its  present form and here's why:1. Frequently force closes on attempts to add new transaction. I see from version history that each time developers report that they have fixed some "force close" issues but it is still there (as of 1.6.4 version).2. Currently EasyMoney supports only 2-level categories. When I attempted to export data from another app with multi-level category support, Easy Money reported that it had successfully exported 41 transactions (which is correct) but after that lost track of 3 transactions that were in sub-sub-categories. This is not a problem by itself (after all nobody promised multi-level category support), the problem is that instead of simply ignoring these transactions or reassigning them to some other category - Easy Money screwed up my entire database. It had added dollar values of those transactions to my total balance - yet transactions themselves were not visible and there was no way to see (and edit/delete) where those numbers came from. Had to reinstall everything.3. Errors in basic math. I had 2 credit card transactions, $160 an $10, and was surprised to see that my total balance was $150. At first I didn't believe it and checked for "+" and "-" signs, "Depostit" - "Withdrawal" checkbox in transaction description - everything was correct yet resulting balance was obviously wrong.To conclude: potentially it'a a winner but way too many bugs.PS: Samsung Vibrant, official Android OS 2.2.PPS: Now, almost 1 year after my initial review I'd like to update it and describe current state of affairs (as of Feb. 2012). My initial verdict was that this app has potential to become the best money-tracking app for Android but has some serious bugs. Not any more! Now I simply cannot express my anger with this app and developer(s). I have purchased it while it whas Amazon's free app of the day and what do I see?! I simply can not add transactions on my new AT&T; SGS2! After pressing "Save & Done" button no new transaction is being saved/created anywhere. App is absolutely useless now because I can not even add transactions!Sorry, devs, but I'm completely disillusioned about your product now. It's absolutely useless. There are other money-tracking apps on the market which just do what they are supposed to do.

It makes you keep actively aware of your finances.It is not connected to any accounts so you do have to keep your records as frequently as you do you check book. The app makes you accountable for your money giving you all the tools to keep an accurate accounting but it will not do it for you. If you forget or don't keep up with your spending it will fail you and frustrate you, but if you keep up with your accounts it will keep you balanced and disciplined. It has made me more accountable for my follies and more disciplined in understanding where my money is going, bad or good.

It *is* free.. if you bother to actually hit the "purchase" button, instead of coming on the review site and griping about something that has *nothing* to do with the performance of the app, your conformation e-mail will tell you it was free.

I currently use the Mint app which automates everything which for me is exactly what I need so I don't think I will make the switch to this app. Some people are not comfortable giving all their log in information to one app like Mint and for those folks this would be a great app.Overall the app functioned well but I did run into some issues where the app would force close when entering in transactions. This didn't happen a lot but it was frustrating when it did. There are a lot of catagories to choose from when creating your budget but I do wish each category had some sub-catagories to better define expenses. Some reviews mention that the app made errors when computing transactions but I never ran into that issue. The interface is slick and intuitive and overall it feels like a professional app.For free you should definitely check out this app if you are in the market for a finance tool. I do not think I could recommend this app at the normal 10 dollar price.EDIT: A commenter pointed out to me that you can create 1 sub-category for each category by following the instructions below. Perhaps the developer will add the ability to add even more sub-cateories since the functionality is built already.Under the Manage Categories (menu button first screen) you can add new categories, edit current categories. The feature is called "Parent Category"

An app does all the work for you and you always have it on you.I've used this app daily now for months (ever since is was free app of the day months ago) and I can tell you from plenty of experience this app works great right out of the box for an everyday check register. I like it much better than several others on the market which are usually either to complicated or to simple to do the job productively and efficiently. However with that being said, it works even harder for you if you'll spend some time working with it and thinking about how to set up and organize all your labels, reminders and etc. Its much more than just a register if you want it to be as it will let you set up budgets, view personalized reports and set up bill reminders for as many accounts as you need. I made an extra account to keep up with gas card charges.Really it cant be explained in a review you just have to spend some time with it to get the most from it. But to give you an idea, you can set-up labels or categories in which to label your transactions and then see budgets and/or reports displayed for those labels. You also have the option of splitting a transaction to different categories, such as grocery's and household items on the same receipt from a discount store.  It also has sub-categories (or parent categories) to further nail down organizing it to work best for you. Another feature is to set-up bill reminders to be reoccurring monthly for all your bills. Set up your info for that bill payment once to repeat every month and with a couple taps its checked off the reminder list and instantly posted to your register (you can adjust the dollar amount for changes as you do this). Have the reminders alert you or if your like me and know you have to pay the bills silence them and you still have the bill list saved for posting payments to your register every month. I also love how it keeps a dictionary and auto predicts your registry entry...enter one transaction for Wal-Mart and from then on when you enter the first few letter "Wa" it'll give "Wal-mart" as a choice for selection. Sounds like an insignificant feature but when your on the go and/or have several transactions to record you'll be thankful.I've seen several references to Mint.com and its app which I've tried out and I just, I don't know, didn't grasp it or care for it. Everything is automated and only works a certain way if and when you have all the info entered and set just right. I just prefer using Easy Money along with my own custom excel spread sheet for my budgeting needs. It just feels like I'm more in control and I get exactly what I expect from it, nothing more and nothing less.Ok, So I like rambled on and made this longer than ever and I know I'm not very good at writing reviews. However its not near as complicated as I made it sound. Just enough features to do all you need but no extra buttons to complicate things. And again, It can be just a great check register if you don't want to learn the rest. So, to sum it up... I love this must have app!

I've never had a problem, and every account-based transaction is there. I use it every day.The only shortcoming I've found is that transfers don't appear in expense reports. It would be nice to see how much of your credit card bills you paid each month.

When setting up an event, simply indicate the recurrence as "2" and the frequency as "week", and then set a start date. The app will then indicate the next event date and you are all set.From what I see, this is a very full featured app, although the previous reviewer was correct in the comment about only allowing a single level of sub-category. As long as that is the level of control you need, this looks like it will perform well for your needs.I only just started checking it out and so do not have extensive experience yet, but those who have long term experience really seem to like it. It is feature rich but not entirely intuitive. It is also not as bad as some of the reviewers would have you think.Give it a shot of you need something like this. From the revision history (goes back to initial release) in the app, it looks like the developer has put a lot of thought and effort into this product.

There isn't an option for bi-weekly pay. Which is quite a glaring omission. Just doubling up doesn't work, since with bi-week you can get more than two payments every so often.Please fix! I don't mind this since I got this for free, but if I had paid almost ten bucks for a budget app that doesn't contain one of the most common types of pay periods? I'd be ticked.

Not so with EasyMoney.  It's light, fast, and very easy to use.  You can add new transactions with two taps of the finger!I'm using it as a replacement for a check register but EasyMoney has a bunch of other useful features too.  There's a bill reminder feature for recurring bills/transactions.  There's a budgeting feature that allows you to set a budget based on pre-defined (or custom) categories.A bunch of reports are available to list expenses and income by category or time (month/date).There is a Quicken import/export feature.  Your Quicken file can be imported.  EasyMoney can export to Quicken too.  You can also import or export CSV files for use with Microsoft Excel.For security, you can require a passcode to access your EasyMoney data.  There's an auto-backup feature to ensure your data is backed up and protected.I haven't had a single problem with EasyMoney and would highly recommend it.

The only thing I have found that is a problem is that you have to keep doing &quot;balance updates&quot;. It doesnt do the math for a lot of transactions very accuratly.

People who refuse to use sites like Mint because they are worried about giving out their checking account info are the same ones still writing checks which have your account number right on the bottom of the check!  Not only that but checks have your name, address, etc.  I would rather give a well known banking website like Mint my info then hand it over on a check to some random clerk.  Take off your tin foil hats and join the modern era.  Tired of archaic old people doing things backwards because they refuse to evolve.This app is nothing more then a glorified paper check recorder for your accounts.  Sorry I am too busy trying to stay afloat after your old backwards screwed up generation wrecked havoc on my generations financial future; to waste MANUALLY entering in transactions.  Can't wait for you all to end up in nursing homes.Stick to the future and use something like Mint instead of this archaic check recorder manual entry style app.

But, I got this app for free, part of amazon's &quot;Paid free app everyday&quot; thing, ( which I find awesome.) Though, it may feel very good for the kindle fire, (because I know that there are some apps that just do not even seem remotely good), have a nice sound of a cash register whenever you put a transaction in, and come ready to go, there are some free apps that can do the exact same thing as this app, maybe even better. $10.00 to be able to track your money? You will be using the app and wondering where the $10.00 went.

I have been using this app for a while, and have had no problems with it. As far as having to manually enter transactions I don't have a problem with it. There are many times when I go and buy a number of different items that are in different categories. If these transactions were automatically entered it wouldn't show that. In fact if the transactions were all entered automatically it would not show any categories. The bank certainly wouldn't know what category to put a transaction in. I have found that the app is very easy to use, and works very well despite having to take 15 or 20 seconds to enter a transaction.

I used to use Splashmoney on my old PalmPilot.  It was great.  I was going to buy the version for the Kindle Fire, but saw more than one really bad review.  So, I looked around and saw that EasyMoney had some pretty good reviews.  Once I finish putting in my budgets, and set up my regular transfers and payments, I think I will find EasyMoney very useful.

The layout is beautiful but that's just about all it has. The biggest feature that I would like is to have this sync with my accounts. It's not here. You literally have to enter any/every transaction manually. I think this app would be helpful if I had tons of different accounts and wanted to have everything available quickly in one place, but I don't. Even if I did, I can't see why I would want to manually enter every single transaction into my phone when online banking or viewing statements online is free everywhere. It's easier for me to use Pageonce for my needs. I don't see why anyone would prefer this over any of the free money apps out there. If this app actually synced with my bank accounts automatically, I'd have made a completely different review.

Devs do a great job of listening to users and adding/fixing features. Ten dollars is the most I've ever paid for an app but I consider it money well spent.Edit: I see this is the FAOTD today. Guess that means all the crazies are gonna come out to trash the rating for any number of reasons that have nothing to do with the actual app. It's a shame, really, since this is a terrific app that does what it says and does it well. I'm still using it a year and a half later... not many other apps I can say that about, if any!

You may be right, but not at all for that reason.  I tried mint for like an hour and I really disliked how it worked.  I changed my back account's password after deciding I disliked it, and their sync with my bank account made me suspicious anyways.  While having things automatically updated would be nice, I am the type of person who is suspicious of almost everyone and everything around me.  So, back onto this app now...Pros:Keep track of your money on your phone.Know how much you have available after incoming expenses.Be able to know when your next insurance payment is using daily reminders.Budgeting which can help you plan your money before you get it.The app doesn't use your bank account info.Cons:All manual entry.Only one sublevel.As far as I am concerned, these cons are a small price to pay for the pros.  I got the app free during one of Amazon's things, but this app is easily worth twice what they ask.  Go ahead and give it a try and I am sure most people will at least like it, if not love it.

But I really don't understand why the price is so high for an app that lacks holo UX, schedule transactions better graphs and most importantly online sync when peer apps offer all this and more. This, of course, IMHO. So I am very glad to have grabbed this for free.

Most of the time it works well but I have found some errors in the Bill Reminder feature. If you pay a bill prior to the date in the Bill Reminder, you can mark it paid but then on the actual date it will post again, deducting it a second time. Luckily I check my entries every day so I can monitor this flaw.The second thing I would like to see is a way to export my entries so they can be printed out. With no way to back up this program, I worry about what happens if my Kindle Fire crashes.The reports: mostly useless.
A1P194720OUHAG,B004GYVYV0,3.03278688525,0.436558280028,0.027562642369,0.000227790432802,0.758,0.5,TRUTHFUL,I will update this review, as well as the Mint.com review (found in the Android Market), over time, as well as change star-ratings (if I feel the need), once I've had time to use both apps.  As of today (1/19/12), all I've done is install both apps (haven't even set them up yet).Some may ask, "Why use both, especially when having to enter all the same data twice, once for each app?"  The answer is twofold - first, to (personally) determine which is the better app.  I do not deny that whichever app proves best for me will also be the best for someone else, but, chances are, based on how I'll be testing, & comparing, the two, my end-result could, bet well, prove the best for most people.  The second reason is to sorta-kinda settle disputes between several reviewers.  Although there are several reasons for why reviewers say one app is better than the other (as reviewed for both apps, and as reviewed in both the Android Market & Amazon Appstore for Android), I will stick to pointing out what appears to be the three most prominent - entering data in one app is easier than the other (this applies to both apps, as reviewed by people), data can automatically be entered in one vs. having to manually enter all data in the other, & (supposedly) being required to enter all login info (username, password, account numbers, etc) for automatic data entry.  Next update (probably tomorrow) will include ease/difficulty of setting up both apps.Update (1/30/12):  Sorry the update took longer than expected, but I was on vacation.  Anyway, EasyMoney & Mint were both relatively simple to set up, although  both had their respective problems. With Mint, if one plans on entering multiple accounts, one (obviously) needs to know all the login information for said accounts.  I also discovered that certain types of accounts can't be entered for the app's auto-update feature, so, for any accounts that fall into such catagories, one must manually enter the data, exactly as you would with all data entered when using EasyMoney.  As for EasyMoney, to be quite frank, it's a PitA.  While setting up the app might be easier than Mint, maintaining it from that point forward isn't worth the time, or effort.  The one (and ONLY) feature that I like with EasyMoney is its ability for you to enter future bill payment information (name/company, date, amount, etc), and receive notifications when said bills are due to be paid.  Other than this one feature, I would avoid using EasyMoney, and stick with only using Mint.  Again, despite the fact that at least one previous reviewer blasted Mint for false beliefs that, by entering your personal banking login information, you were providing said info to an unknown person, the truth of the matter is, mint is from Intuit, a very well-known, and very well-respected financial services company, know for such products as Quicken, QuickBooks, and TurboTax.  If you can't trust Intuit, then you also can't trust your own bank, and you might as well take your money from the bank, and stuff it into your bed mattress.  Considering EasyMoney was the free download-of-the-day on the day i acquired it, the only...and I do mean only...reason I might (I haven't decided if it's worth the additional trouble) consider using it is for the bill payment reminder feature.  Of course, being that I (obviously) have an Android phone, and added to the fact that I use Outlook, I can just as easily enter the same info into either my phone's calender or Outlook, and have reminders appear in both.FINAL JUDGEMENT:  Between EasyMoney & Mint, I can only recommend Mint.  EasyMoney is too much of a PitA to use on an ongoing basis.  It requires you to not only manually enter every transaction (incoming, as well as outgoing, funds), but you are also required to manually select the transaction type.  Mint, on the other hand, not only automatically downloads all transaction data, but, in the majority of cases, it correctly selects the correct transaction type. I will admit that I have been a TurboTax user for many years, but, at the same time, I have never previously used Quicken.  With the full integration between Mint, Quicken, & TurboTax, that is another advantage that Mint has over EasyMoney.  As such, my original 4* rating for EasyMoney has been lowered to a 1* rating.  Initially, it appeared to be promising, but, in the end, it's anything but "easy".

I used this app for quite awhile but missed not being able to use on multiple devices (phone, fire, and pc).  So I experimented with a couple of different "syncing" apps.I tried Mint, but do not like giving bank account access to apps and didn't need all the financial investment/budgeting suggestions.  I tried Clear Checkbook, but it did some weird "jiving" and subtracted bill "reminders" from account balances without being told and viewing reminders was only available on the internet.  While these are good apps for someone wanting those applications they were not good solutions for my use.So, I went back to Easy Money gladly.  This app is very straightforward and simple to use.  It is a checkbook register and a bill reminder app.  That is what it claims and that is what it does.  It is well worth paying the minimal price for and is only "required" if you want to be able to access your sd back-up if you change devices.  I think this is a great app that does what is promised.  The only thing it is missing is being able to sync, using a simple process, with other devices, but there is the ability to import and export csv files.  For me that is more work than it is worth and it is easier to just get my phone and keep everything on one device but syncing would be a handy function and make the app more usable for those needing access for more than one user (joint accounts).

I've been using a planner to keep up with the budgets because I don't like programs that require access to my bank account, and because things take forever to clear that way.  I much prefer to keep track manually, so this was perfect for me.  I wish that there were bi-monthly options for payment and budgeting, and I only started actually using it on my Kindle Fire for a couple of days, but so far, bug-free and very handy!  The only other issue... $10 is a little high.  I never would have tried it if it weren't free.

Many of the shows I like are located on the AM band and thus not available on some devices that only broadcast FM. And if you listening in the car you may drive out of range for good reception. TuneIn Radio to the rescue!This application is very well organized, easy to use, the sound is great, no buffering delays.  What I like best about the UI that is very easy to narrow down on your favorite show by just searching on the title, and then select from several choices.  You can store your favorites in the 'favorites' list for quick access.When the app comes up you get a list of choices:- Local radio- Recents- Recommended- Music- News- Sports- Talk- By location- By language- PodcastsIf you select Talk shows you get further refinements:- Business- Comedy- Conservative- Entertainment- Ideas- News- Progressive- Public- Religious- Specialty TalkThen if you select, say, Public Radio then you get a list of NPR stations from all over USA so you have more choices of times for the specific program you like.This app works well on my Samsung Galaxy 7.7 Tablet running Android HoneyComb 3.2. I had no technical problems and the app scales to my screen size very nicely.This is a terrific app: Huge amount of choices for radio shows, great reception, excellent interface. I highly recommend.Ali Julia review

I found many of the stations I prefer in the lists it had.  We also follow sports.  It has a pretty good selection of these as well.As with most radio programs it can be a bit choppy while it is buffering.  I did not see much to help configure it to reduce the chopiness.  Maybe I missed it.  If it is not there adding some buffer managment and other tolls would be appeciated.

It ran great until the station was changing because it was in shake mode. Please do yourself a favor and change the Apps settings so that it does not do shake mode for changing the stations. This setting stays on even after the app is shut off or removed. It will interfere with the running of the Kindle Fire. Any movement of the Fire will reset the screen, and apps. Books will not open. Hard reset will not work. Device settings will open but will not correct the problem unless you remove everything by resetting to factory defaults.I reinstalled it and it seems to work again.Other than that. Its a likeable App.

It was a breeze to setup the BBC radio stations and i am loving how will integrated it is to the Amazon Fire experience.The favourites section is just great and the radio discovery piece again, beautiful.  Nice touch where it detects where roughly you are in the world (based i assume on IP) and offers you the local stations.The UI is clean and sharp and listening to a radio station while using other software on the device proves no difficultly.  Sadly on the Amazon Fire, if you are listening via the browser, as soon as you move focus away from that tab, or the device blanks the screen, the radio stops.This software is the missing link ... and best of all its free.

Layout is good and it's easy to use.  There are a lot of stations available.  However, none of the stations listed for my locale actually work. And some of the  most popular ones aren't even listed.  Very disappointing.  I had high hopes for this app, but it falls well short of my expectations.

It really is the local radio station and not just random music.Some radio stations are not able to be played at certain times. I assume this is due to paid programming (ie Bob and Tom Show, etc) where the radio station subscribes to a program. This is frustrating, but I understand the issue. I would think that there would be a way around it because the you can listen to the radio free from that town, why not listen to it free from further away.I did find that if you listen to an actual radio and listen to TuneIn, they do not match up. There must be some delay before it get's to TuneIn. This delay is not 1 or 2 seconds but possibly minutes or several songs.It's still a great app and I use it.

With literally thousands of stations to choose from, it's a positive win-win for everyone. This is all wrapped up in a neat 100% zero cost package. It's practically impossible to loose.The player is silky smooth w/o any interruption experiences encountered on other sites. Add this to the fact that the audio quality is (superb) First Rate.The controls are extremely EZ to use as well as offering options for personalization to enhance your listening enjoyment. TuneIn Radio offers an extensively wide selection of genres to satisfy even the most discriminating listener. Topping everything, I am thankfully not bombarded with ads or in-app purchasing as with other internet radio sites.I operate this on a Kindle Fire HD.  My personal experience has been absolutely excellent. I totally recommend it!!Additionally -  The TuneIn Radio development/support team appears to take an active interest in suggestions from their site users for future system advancements/enhancements. I had submitted a modification suggestion for future consideration centering on a control feature. Within minutes, I received a reply in the e-mail in box confirming their receipt of the item and 're-routing of it to the development team. VERY IMPRESSIVE. Thanks for listening!!

All it says is &quot;You're listening to the world's radio. On TuneIn!&quot; It wastes 10 seconds just to tell us what app we're using. We obviously know that if we're using the app. It's so pointless, and serves only to remind me who is annoying me.

While it linked to the station back home, it didn't play the same programs.  I think the custom local feed, was not used in the link.  This was disappointing.

With TuneIn, I get crystal clear stereo radio, exactly as if I were listening on the regular radio (slight time lag, so don't try to win any call-in contests while listening via TuneIn!)Add to that, I can listen to other stations across the country... not just in my tiny closed area with little radio choices.I'm using it on an AT&T-branded; Samsung Galaxy S3, and so far I've had no problems at all.

And we can only use up so much data allowance per day. An app like this will quickly go through all your allowance. We are on satellite and don't have the most expensive plan so we do have to be careful of how much we use. But it will be really nice if we are staying in a motel where we can listen to the music all night. Which by the way, you can choose any state, then any station and then any type of music. Even talk radio. Anything you could possibly want to listen to. Probably one of the nicest apps around.

You can look up stations either by location or by genre, but you can easily create a list of bookmarks of favorite stations instead of having to browse each time.The audio quality is superb, and there is almost no loading/buffering time. It hasn't once dropped the station once playback began, which I can't say about some of the other programs I've tried.Some might be wondering whether this is necessary if they have Pandora installed on their phones. This is! Pandora is great for discovering new music, but this streams not only music stations, but talk radio, too. Similarly, if your phone came pre-installed with a radio chip, this is still a great app because it allows you to listen to many radio stations around the world.This program is really a pleasure to use: its user interface is very intuitive, its audio quality is very impressive, and there is a wide range of radio stations available. I am running this on a Droid 2 Global running Froyo and have never had any problems with the program freezing or crashing. I strongly recommend this!

You get access to 100's of radio stations all over the country.  Basically turns your phone into a radio but one that is easy to carry around.  Now you can listen to the radio on an ipod but only local.  For some people that is no big deal but for sports fans etc, this can be pretty cool.  Like it!

It installed easily, and the user interface is clean and simple. The app gives you access to a huge range of radio options -- you can select local stations or select a category (such as news, sports, talk, music, etc.) which then brings up a wide range of local and non-local stations.You can also select specific music genres, such as "classic rock," "country,", etc. and it then presents you with all the stations that specialize in that type of music. You can even select by language should you want to listen to stations that broadcast in a particular language (and the language list is huge!).One of my favorite features is the podcast menu. If allows access to It also includes a podcast menu that has a huge list of podcasts on every topic you could think of. A real treasure-trove for podcast fans.It allows you to set favorites, and automatically tracks a list of recent stations listened to. Playback has been very clear for me, with only an occasional stutter. It works in both portrait and landscape modeI'm having an enormous amount of fun finding new radio stations. Highly recommend!!

If you were ever looking into the logitech internet radios that cost in the 100s this app functions and does everything that the logitech product does. A very nice app with access to any radio station I can think of in any city, state country. Was listening to music in Daka bangladesh, (I think thats the capital). The New York link has hundreds of stations and the buffering works quite fast.An excellent app.

Station call letters are about as useful as a nipple on a chicken for making a decision on whether that is the station I want - or, for example, when looking for weatherband stations they all say the same thing and you have to select, nope, search again, select 2nd one, nope, search again, select 3rd one, nope, search again...

TuneIn can kind of get confusing to me too.  The iHeart Radio app is much easier to get around in.

And all radio stations are grouped together instead of having to go to individual sites.

I live 2-3 hours from most of the surrounding major cities, so I get terrible AM service. That is where most of the great sports radio takes place. It is great for me to tune in to sports talk from Chicago and St Louis, then be able to go around the country to wherever my heart desires. I can listen to my favorite team news from where I grew up and that makes this program the bomb!Admittedly, there are some stations that don't work with TuneIn and that is too bad. Also, if it is a major sporting event in MLB, NFL or the NBA, blackout restrictions apply and I truly understand that.The final sell point is that they feature any kind of music you want. It isn't from SIRIUS/XM with their canned DJ's, but it's hometown music with your local flavor. To me, that is the best thing. I may have never lived in certain parts of the country, but I can get the flavor of being there. Awesome program, TuneIn!

I have other apps for when I want to listen to &#34;genres&#34; of music pulled from a music library -- apps like Pandora, and even iHeartRadio.  But many of the other apps don't do live streaming -- or don't do it well.I often base my initial satisfaction with an app on how quickly I can open the app for the first time and get to what I want to do.  When I installed TuneIn Radio, it was because I wanted my favorite local FM station -- WDAV, a 24/7 Classical music station -- available when I was not at/near an FM radio.  I was up and running, listening to the station in just a minute or two.  That's &#34;ease of use&#34;.

I needed a radio streaming app to get away from massive commercials and wimpy programming. TuneIn finds worldwide radio stations. Sometimes there are buffering issues. You can search by genre, etc. I had major buffering issues with an Itunes radio station - Venice Classical radio.  ( my favourite - just fine music, no commercials or rude interruptions like &#34;subscribe now!&#34; )Tunein has replaced Itunes Radio for this purpose. Very user friendly, many choices and a good alternative to Pandora as well.

I also like the podcasting choices, i have listened to many episodes of This American Life (highly recommend that show).  And this app is easy and reliable and doesn't crash, unlike some other radio app's i have tried.  I bought the Pro version on my iphone, and I can also record live radio on it for listening later.  Very nice app.

Can't always find a station via iTunes radio that doesn't cut in with their own coverage either when such events occur. TuneIn Radio has--so far, and I emphasize so far--been better.

Sofar I have just concentrated on music but even there it opens up whole new worlds. If you like classical, you can listen to local NPR music station, or to one in London, or I often like Avro, a Dutch baroque music station. I have tried New Age, World Fusion, and each category gives one again several choices. And the sound of the HD Kindle Fire is just wonderful. Yes the Kindle comes to bed with me where I often will continue to listen to music with lights out. Listened to station in South Africa. One can choose music according to language. I would love the Kindle if this were the only thing it did. It is just so amazing. On my laptop I used to listen to Itunes radio but they did away with that. Don't understand their thinking. Anyway, they made changes to Itunes for the worst of it.

And you don't know how wonderful radio is until you don't have it anymore.  And the sound quality is good (I set the buffer to about 25 seconds) and the quality is really good and the selection of stations is wonderful--just wonderful.  I highly recommend this app to anyone. Also, I tried the alarm feature this morning and it worked great.

Stations are plentiful and I can even get radio stations 1500 miles away back home that I miss on this app. It gives you the ability to favorite stations. It also gives you the ability to favorite songs. Then the app uses your selections and recommends other stations you may like.Reception is fantastic, seems like there are hardly any commercials.I was only a tad disappointed because I thought when I  &#34;favorite&#34; a song that it was allowing me to make my own playlist. But after I checked it does bring up all of the songs you marked as favorite but it won't allow you to listen to them; at that point you are only left with purchasing the songs. Other than that; I would have given this app 5 stars.Regards,~ Holley Jacobs

While local radio isn't a big deal to me it quickly found all my &quot;local&quot; stations without issue. But, seriously? Forget that. Start browsing around and listen to stuff outside your home country. Listened to a bunch of stations in Romania for a while, for no particular reason than that we could.Have encountered a few stations that, while listed, don't play. Now who knows why this is? Perhaps the stations streaming server has issues? Maybe they somehow blocked TuneIn from accsessing it? I don't hold it against the app though; just part of online life in my book!Know that several stations still continue to stream fine even when my phone drops down to 1x on Verizon. So to those complaining about buffering and such, it's either your connection and/or the stations streaming bit rate is more than your connection wants to deal with. Once again, AFAIK, not the apps fault.Really happy with it. Sleep timer is great as I use it every night to help me pass out. Has an alarm setting too; haven't played with that yet. Presets seem to work fine too... and that's a good thing.

Great selection of stations, but users need to understand that many of the stations aren't broadcasting 24hr/7days/week.  For example, I was able to listen to the Green Bay Packers game on tunein today, but that station is only available as a live broadcast unless you buy the pro version which I understand to be buggy and/or limited with regard to recording and playback options.  However, there are many live radio stations, both local and from around the world that are available all the time.  I'm so impressed with the free version that I couldn't ask for more.  I do recommend it highly.

I especially like how the search will group talk shows by how much time is remaining. It's nice to be able to catch that talk radio program at the beginning!

The tendency to replay a loop of the past few seconds while buffering, not so much), but when they started playing highly targeted ads that could only have been selected for me by accessing my email content, I dropped them like a hot coal. Sometimes extensive permissions really are necessary for reasons that aren't immediately obvious, so I gave them the benefit of a doubt when I first downloaded the app, but in this case, your suspicions are warranted.

I like it, as it finds stations that may not exist on other services --like KNAC-- so, I consequently get to listen to what I want.  I wish we had something like the Kindle Fire HD when I was a kid, then I could pull in stations from around the world to my pleasure.

I like being able to have favorite stations and also recent station for reference. You can also listen to news,  events, just search and you will find something to enjoy. I have this on my phone to listen with earplugs outdoors while gardening as a change from my iPod. I used to live on the other coast so it is fun for me to listen to stations from that area but there are also stations around the world as well better than a previous app and much better than iHeart radio app.

Im able to search for and listen to radio stations broadcasted in the UK. Any type of music you are interested in, there is a radio station that specifically plays it and this app will let you access them.

On my Kindle Fire HD, a recent update makes it perform outstandingly & without fault. I very much like the organization & selection of worldwide music with a huge range of categories. Features & functions as a clock-radio and a purchase interface have been outstanding. Battery usage is minimal. It plays for hours as I fall asleep with a darkened screen and hardly any impact on the battery whatsoever. I like the ability to create a &#34;favorites&#34; list and the &#34;car&#34; mode is super. It's hard to imagine the &#34;pay-for&#34; version being much better.

I particularly enjoy listening to radio stations elsewhere in the U.S. and also in the U.K.  I found this app great for finding stations by location and genre.  You can select presets for your favorite stations.  Right now I'm listening to BBC Radio 1 in England.  I'll try Australia in a bit.I am new to apps on  mobile devices and the Fire can sometimes be a bit slow to respond when you tap on an option, but that's the only issue I had.  Also, the first time after I stopped playing within the app and then when back to it from the Fire's home page, I got a screen that tried to push me to get the Pro version.  It took me a bit to figure out how to move on from that page.  I was thinking I was going to have to delete the app when I tapped on the logo at the top and it took me to the radio menu.I liked the app so well I added a link to it on my PC.  But I'm really thrilled to have found it for Fire.

I am forced to fire up a task manager to kill the application.The other incredibly frustrating issue with the program is that, even after I have used a task manager to forcefully kill the app., the app. occasionally restarts itself in the background.Fix those two issues and it's a five star application.

One a full charge and running for 6+ hours, along with game apps, the battery does not wear down.  I was easily able to find the station I was after, something with country classics.  While not everyone's cup of tea, the 1 radio station I could receive at my job was stale with 'new' country.  Sound is crisp and clear and I rarely lose connection with the station.

But, after 3 years of using that app and enduring the countless &#34;improvements&#34; and &#34;upgrades&#34; to that app, I finally deleted it, downloaded THIS one and am glad for it! No silly nonsense of endless &#34;loading...loading...loading&#34; or &#34;Buffering...Buffering...Buffering&#34; as the Radio.com app became, this one goes right to the preset station I listen to and works flawlessly.Good Bye Radio.com, Hello TuneIn Radio! :D

For some reason though, some of the stations that they have listed are not available and the one that I listen to the most is one of them.  I would definitely recommend it because of all of the options that you have to choose from.

Some that are hard to get to tune in on a regular radio come in crystal clear with this app (like radio disney).  My guess as to why certain stations are not available is they're under contract with other applications.

I am seeking a program that is actually an &#34;FM&#34; tuner.  I had it on my Thunderbolt, but can't seem to find it now for my DNA phone.  It is a live FM radio tuner, no streaming thing,  just live FM. Real kind of FM radio.  In fact it was called FM Radio, and had a lil tuner on the screen you could tune to any broadcast frequency at any time and listen to live radio, news, sports and all.  No selecting the kind of music, and all that.  just RADIO.!!  This isn't it.!  sorry.

I cannot explain all the 5* reviews. I downloaded this app an hour ago, tuned to my favorite overseas channel and hopped in the shower. Admittedly it was a long shower but in 45 minutes I had to jump out, dry my hands, log into my phone, check the app, force start it, jump back in the shower and continue sudsing up, a total of 7 times. So you can see why I'm not enjoying this app. Sorry, but it's a big thumbs down and immediate uninstall.Maybe the next time the devs write another review they should be a bit more honest. one can wish!

I also listen to streaming weekly shows about the internet and electronics. (mainly twit) I like listening to obscure stations from all over the US reminds me of traveling by car. The free version has ads and the paid version does not but I like the ads, it's the American way!Sorry to say after listening to the free version, every time it changed ads there was much digital sputtering, making it unlistenable.Reminds me of the old dial-up days. The ads change a lot and if the ads blinked on and off, Whoa, Nelly! This is the first time I've had problems with Tune-In. I love it on my phone and Nook reader, so I went ahead and bought the paid  version, and what do you know....it's perfect!

The real issue I have is that the stations will just stop playing for no known reason.  it doesn&apos;t say anything about buffering.  \n\nAlso the &apos;REPORT A PROBLEM&apos; link always tells you to try another station and never reports a problem.

Yet here we are, here I am, with a request from Amazon to rate this product. First...IT WORKS! But why shouldn't it? One assumes that these free apps have been tested before they are released. The sound quality is quite good, but that's more a function of the phone than the app itself. And so there we are. Perhaps, in six months or so, when I've used this app for a while, I may reevaluate it and update this review. And I may not. In my opinion Amazon needs to reevaluate its product review policies to allow users more time before they request and expect a review.

I replaced Slacker Radio and Scanner Radio with TuneIn as it does everything that both apps do better, and without any of the artificial limitations placed on most free apps. It certainly encouraged me to purchase the paid version. There is also no intrusive / annoying advertising.Pros:-- Wide selection of Radio stations, emergency bands, online streams, etc.-- No annoying advertising.-- No features advocating the paid version (features not available in the free version are taken out, and don't get in your way or pop up asking you to upgrade).-- UI is well done, and always keeps the currently playing station handy at the bottom so you can stop and start it quickly.Cons:-- None that I can honestly list as cons. It would be nice to be able to record radio, however, as this is in the paid version I can't honestly list it as a con.

It list all the radio station from all over the country but what you need to know is that they are not all able to play on this app. I was trying to listen to my local country stations in Colorado and it always went to a radio station in Alaska. I also checked my favorite country stations in Alabama and it always went to the same station in Alaska.

Well maybe you do because the interface for TuneIn Radio is clunky.The people who designed the user interface must be mass transit commuters because I'm convinced they've never used this in a car before.You have to pull over to use make simple changes in your car. You can't do simple stuff quick enough during a red light. I get about 80% of the way there when the light turns green, then at the next red light you have to start over again. But the radio selection is excellent and the quality is great. I play it through the Blue Tooth on my car radio.I wish it had a BIG Radio Button Feature so that I could change stations easily and a Re-Connect button when I lose a connection.It's close, real close, to being a great application.

They're either 'idle' or play for two seconds and load for fifteen in between every two- second play. What a waste! Maybe it's my phone, but i doubt it. I have an LG Optimus; if you have one too i suggest you NOT waste your time on this app. I really think that this app is nothing more then a cross country radio station index. Most of the stations don't even load.

Three in a row when I started it. Bad app.In addition to that, as if it weren't enough, gameplay is bakwards! If I tilt up the ball goes down, left it goes right. Totally counterintuitve.The game itself looks decent. But not great. Take a pass on this one.

All movements were misinterpreted by 90 degrees, e.g. tilting tablet left and right made the ball roll up and down.  However, after changing X-Y axis settings, the game works well.  I like it.

It can get very addictive, and thankfully the game remembers which levels you have completed.  The game has several levels of difficulty, with a load of maps for each.  Vibration is made use of as well, giving you the feel of playing on one of those old wooden games each time your ball knocks into a solid object.  Nicely done.What wasn't so nice was the very frequent pestering to sign up for this, that, or the other thing.  I get it, it's an ad support game.  Cool with me.  The little banner ad at the top of the screen was no big deal, but the repeated full screen nagging to subscribe to various mailing lists was *very* annoying and cost this game a couple stars.Controls - The game includes a calibration tool, and it seemed pretty accurate to me in judging how far and hard I was moving my phone around.  You can turn the vibration off if you're not into that, turn off the sound, and make a few other adjustments to tone the game's performance to more closely match your device's horsepower.Graphics - Graphics were very nicely rendered and flowed smoothly at the default settings.  If your device isn't up to it, you can tone the graphics down a bit, including going to 2D mode.Sounds - Basic and no background music.Stability & Performance - Game was stable and played smoothly.Extras - Open Feint, for recording your high scores and showing off.

It's just like the mazes I played as a kid, where you had to move a metal ball through a maze to reach a hole. There was little replay value with those, however, since once you mastered it, it was the same thing over and over. With 3D Labyrinth, there are a lot of different mazes (they call them maps) with varying degrees of difficulty. The balls roll very accurately when you tilt the Kindle Fire, and the sound and graphics are quite good. Winning isn't just a matter of getting the ball in the hole - the game records your times, so you could compete against friends to have the lowest elapsed time.Some of the mazes are really clever-and tough-with moving flippers and other shapes that can hinder you or help you, depending on how you play them.Getting to the game is a bit aggravating, since you go through a few screens where they want you to sign up for stuff, but it's easy enough to skip these screens. Occasionally, one of these &#34;nag&#34; screens pops up after solving a maze, but you can click to skip it.The game uses OpenFeint to compare scores, but you're not forced to register with OpenFeint if you don't want to.

Great game at least on my Fire.

You need steady hands, lol. (which I don't have some days, lol)

Simple game play, by tilting your Kindle to get the ball in the right hole and avoid the wrong holes. Even the "Easy" level has been challenging so I can't imagine what's in store in the more advanced levels. It's one of those games that you have a hard time putting down.

This one has a lot of maps so hopefully won't be so easy.It is a little laggy and the ball can be jumpy. Also, I got tricked into signing up when I first launched the app. It said I'd get a code for more maps but the code was invalid. Hopefully I won't get some bunch of spam because of it.

Of course it gets difficult and frustrating as you get further into the game. I almost came close to deleting this app because I started to get frustrated,  but I just took my time and got through it. This game teaches you how to have balance and control. I still have a lot of levels to complete.

It is one of those games, the ones that no matter how angry you get while playing, it is still fun. When you win a level after what seems like a million tries, you feel on top of the world.

The menu needs to be revamped with better style as there is too many things to press before one can start playing the game and is annoying.2. Most of the time the app does not seem to register taps on the menus (Tested on Kindle Fire)The game gets very challenging with lots of holes where the balls slides thru' Please make provisions for the ball to re-emerge somewhere else rather than starting from scratch it will make this app even more engaging and challenging.Please make some boards with different background colors as it might get more interesting to play rather than seeing the same color board every-time.Thanks for reading my comments.

My tablet isn't the most advanced one around, so I had to put the game on 2D mode - but once set there, this game was a pure delight to play. Plus, the boards get increasingly more difficult and there's even player-created boards you can download. All of these things are just plain wonderful.However... I also want to give this app one star. The ads are just ridiculous. Installing it is a nightmare of hidden "skip" buttons and attempts to make you sign up for sponsored mailing lists and adware. VERY annoying - and I can't even express how much that "VERY" needs to be in huge, bold letters.The sad thing is that this developer doesn't need to sink to that kind of level to sell their game. It's a darn good game that could easily sell itself. Instead, I find myself conflicted on what to do here. Part of me wants to buy the ad-free version to support a game I find very enjoyable... but mostly, I find myself not wanting to "reward" a developer for using such downright annoying methods to try to sell their game.To be honest, the ads here are making me NOT buy a game I would otherwise have happily paid for. I just can't condone this kind of obnoxious advertising practice.

With this tilt game you get near endless puzzles to solve, from easy to quite challenging. The graphics and sound effects are very nice. It's a nice break from fast paced games of the 21st century. Not for everyone but I recommend it.

I like how it's laid out as well.  Sometimes I've noticed that the daily horoscopes don't update.

This app goes into detail like none other. It's not just a hokey horoscope. It goes into details about each sign. Each element. Each phase. Astro tools.

This is not just one of those fortune cookie type things...I use it everyday. It's the first thing I look at. Even before e mails or news. Great great app. I would suggest this one above all others.

I really appreciate her monthly forecasts online, her yearly calender, and now her app. I read my daily horoscope with the app. It's pretty helpful and accurate. There's other valuable info on there, too, like explaining the planets and houses. Also included are the fun stuff like how you match up with each sign and gift giving by the signs, ect...

This is the type of game perfected for that piece of hardware that makes me want to dig mine out even though the Kindle would simply look at that antiquated technology and permanently shut itself down before being attached to something so quaint.Instead we are given a touchscreen joystick and it's amusing at times to see something that would be considered retro be recreated for current technology. I'm not completely sold on touchscreen joysticks as my fingers tend to not slide well at times and it requires holding the Kindle in a certain way so I can move and shot at the same time in these games.  Yet for MiniSquadrom it's the only type of control that I can see working and for what it is, it works well and is responsive.In this game you fight waves of planes in a small area.  Unlike games of this genre of yor where you continued to pass the background as you shot down the enemy, you are kept between two invisible walls that you fly between. While it is obvious that you do not want to hit the ground, if you fly up too high you can also stall, which is a nice touch. Sadly the instructions for the stall about turning into the way you are falling isn't all that helpful when you are falling straight down. Trial and error will make you a pro at recovering from a stall.There are power-ups in the game that looking like falling stars of different colors that you can catch. If they hit an enemy plane first they're gone. They are a bit finicky and you have to be careful that you aren't going to run into the ground while desperately trying to grab one. You can also pick up extra lives and the hearts remain flying around on screen long enough to give you a fair chance to grab them.  And you will want to grab them because as enemies become more dangerous you will die a lot due to poorly timed stall recoveries right into area of affect attacks. Fortunately your little plane is made from the strongest metal known to the dwarfs of Moria and can be riddled with bullets, missiles and other planes running straight through it before you finally crash and burn like the irresponsible hero you are.The one thing I truly dislike is when it tells you that you've completed the wave or reached a check point. The message itself appears in a bar across the middle of the screen with the rest slightly darkened.  But the game is not paused. So if you have chosen this unfortunate time to go into a stall it's going to be that much harder to recover. I'm fine with giving me messages but if it's going to be in the way of the game then the game needs to be paused or the message needs to be moved.All in all this is a fun little game. Looking at the price I recall getting most of the shooters I played two decades ago for around $5 from a bargain bin, so the price seems fair for the content.  There are 56 planes you can unlock total and looking at the shadows of yet to earn planes raises many questions such as how can I ride a trident and when did whales learn to fly.  It could be very interesting to see what all these planes look like and do.It works well, for all you Kindle Fire HD users out there.  I would give it between 3.5 - 4 stars with a few extra points to providing classical music that is complimentary to blowing things up.

MiniSquadron brings back memories of the 16-bit era when games where about one thing and one thing only - fun. Not hyper-realistic graphics or realistic physics but just pure,simple fun. MiniSquadron is an entertaining and challenging flight game that I highly recommend.

Some of the 1 stars reviews didn't help either. I thought why not give it a chance since its free today. Found out this game is much better then the screen shots would lead one to believe. I thought this would be one of those side scrolling games like an old school nes game. The plane you control flies in all directions,  and rolls to an upright position on its own. The controls looked very small in the screen shots, but expand when you use them making the control circle bigger while using. The flight control and fire control were both very smooth and very responsive. This game is just plain fun. No pun intended. I've already earned a few of the 50 planes that are available. Going to wrap up this review so I go back to playing this game. If you can get it as FAOTD, you have no reason at all not to get this game. I would pay a few bucks for this game, cause it is definitely worth it. The soundtrack is classical musical, which really classed up the game in my opinion.  Nice little touch. Very nice indeed. (Of course the music can be turn off, and your own music played in background if classical isn't something you care for)Played on Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1

I enjoyed playing it. It's very touch responsive on Kindle Fire, and Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  I played only a few level and enjoyed the game play so far. It's simple, and cute. Not too many buttons to press. The planes that has higher speed, makes me dizzy. It spins so fast, and moves so fast. I prefer the slower planes.  My 2 years old son love to crash the plane. Definitely worth 2.99 but I got it as free app of the day.

What I appreciate are that the controls are nice, and you get that 3D aspect where it feels like you are flying. That is one of the best parts for me, as it is amazingly fun, and I can see a lot of people gravitating towards this game for that particular reason. The music used in the game is beautiful and very soothing as you try to blast other planes out of the sky. The game itself is very easy to play, but going for all planes can be quite frustrating at times. It is worth the price and a fun time killer.

This can be attributed to its side-scrolling platform, but this just enhances play as the difficulty of 3D is taken away but replaced with loads enemies flying across your screen with different capabilities. You even get new planes after playing certain levels, which is great when you need that edge to beat a level that you can't do with your favorite plane.

Providing hours of gameplay and plenty of replay value $3 may not seem so bad of a price.*Pros:- 56 different planes to chooses from, several different weapon styles and 8 different (but not entirely unique) maps. Planes are challenging but fun to unlock and the weapon styles dun to master.- Controls are nearly flawless. Simple, tight and easy to use controls make gameplay fun and easy.- Graphics are fun and cute, parents need not worry about their kid playing this game.- Gameplay is great, dogfighting against spaceships, flying turtles fighter jets and other miscellanies is a blast, and while it may get quite difficult, it's hard to feel the urge to give up.*Cons- Crashes. This is essentially why this app received four stars instead of five. They typically haven't happened to me in gameplay but quite often after completing a survival level. It's definetely something to be aware of with this game.In short, the game is great for any type of gamer, from the 9 year old playing Mario Kart to the 23 year old playing Dead Space. Just be aware of the crashing problem.

It reminds me a lot of the old arcade game Time Pilot, enhanced with some physics (stalling, acceleration when diving, etc).  Overall, it's a great game, but I only gave it 4 stars due to the limited re-playability (you can redo levels with new planes, but no new challenges).

The Controls are an ON-Screen Joystick and s Fire Button that work very well once you get used to them.  You get to choose from many different cool Planes after you play awhile and they all have different specifications like Weight,  Speed, Weapons, etc.  They can STALL like real planes and recover if you pull up in time properly.Game play is lots of Fun and has Realistic feel to it.  Blue arrows tell you when and where OFF-Screen enemies are approaching so you can get ready for them.  Messages pop up when you are starting to Stall or when you fly TOO LOW so it helps you to attempt recovery before you crash.Graphics are high quality HD and the Music and Sound Effects are very good.  Sound levels can be adjusted from Options Menu.  Controls are easy to learn and work Smoothly on my Tablet.Lots of Power-Ups (like Stars and Hearts) can be acquired by catching them in flight.Information Bar on top of screen tells you how many Lives you have left, Enemies left, etc.It is fast paced but not a FRANTIC level from what I have seen so far.  Very simple and ENJOYABLE.Seems like a well designed game with no obvious flaws or annoyances that I have seen.  The only thing I would like to see different is an OPTION TO REVERSE CONTROLS from left to right Joystick so people (like myself) with hand disabilities or weaknesses in dexterity can compensate by swapping.It is very Enjoyable, Challenging, Entertaining and Fun to engage the other Aircraft in Combat.  I like this app and would Recommend it to anyone who likes this type of game.  It is a Keeper.

(as mine did, from playing too much).It was great for one complete play through (a few hours), but wasn't great enough to go back and try to unlock all the planes I had missed.There are a tonne of planes to unlock.I got it for free, so no complaints.  I uninstalled after my initial play through though.

The navigation/shooting buttons are easy and work very well. Your object is to bring down the other planes which come in waves. There are three modes to play: classic, survival and multiplayer.In classic they start you off shooting ducks, I guess that is to get you used to the buttons without having to worry about being shot at because that was only the first wave. Then it increasingly gets harder as they add more planes throughout the waves.In survival mode they add many planes at a time and you have to be the last man standing. In both modes they have power ups which do different things such as speed up, slow down, make invisible, missile attack and more. These power ups are stars of different colors you will see floating around but be quick because the enemy can get to them as well. You may also see hearts around which give you extra life.Even if you are shot at or shoot another plane, you/they do not die after one shot. I believe it has to be at least four shots but not difficult enough to frustrate you, it will challenge however.I have not played multiplayer yet so I cannot say how that is but I am eager to see it. Throughout the game you unlock more airplanes and land to play with/at. I have yet to unlock a new land but they are there giving you something to work for making the game more interesting as well. Overall it is a very good game that kids will definitely enjoy but so will the parents. Music is not bad either.

You fly your plane by using the joystick type control at the bottom left of the screen and try shooting using the fire button on the bottom right of the screen. Simple controls. You shoot the planes down that show up and the level progresses in difficulty. There are stars that fall from the sky and they have rewards or not. Sometimes it will freeze your enemies or sometimes it makes you fly slowly. Each star has either a benefit or a curse that only lasts a little while. Fun game.

With many levels and even more airplanes to choose from, there's tons of replay value to be had here.  The game has so much character, with each plane animating in their own cute way.  Everything about it feels high quality, and the chaotic dog-fights are beautiful to just even watch.  The asking price of $3 may be a little steep, but Mini Squadron is a great game addition to your app collection.Graphics - Gorgeous graphics, from the detailed background scenery to the colorful planes trailing streams of smoke or flames.Sound - Plenty to hear when planes, bullets, bombs and missiles are flying!  The music is very interesting as it is just different popular classical pieces played on a piano.  It fits very well with the comical and chaotic gameplay.Controls - One of the few apps that doesn't slack on its virtual joystick and button controls!  They work so well you don't even think about them, and its hard to when you are fighting for your life against wave after wave of enemy fighters.  I noticed the controls are very flexible and forgiving, allowing you to press the button without your finger having to be too accurate on the button.Gameplay - Very addicting!  On my Galaxy Note 2, the game runs great and loads fast.  There's plenty of challenge completing the levels and tons of fun unlocking and playing as different planes, and there's A LOT of planes to choose from.  The random power-ups also help keep things interesting and humorous, with my favorite power-up being the mega laser!  A multiplayer mode is also included for up to 2 players versus each other over the Wi-Fi.  I haven't tried this, but sounds like a very fun feature!  Would be better if it were cooperative instead of competitive though.5 of out 5 stars!  Aim high!

I have no issue using the controls.At first, I thought this game was entirely too easy, but as the levels continued, the game got harder. I liked the UFO in the game as well. The music was classical and fit the game very well. The graphics are cute and well done. I did feel sorry for the ducks though. There are a ton of different planes you can play, after you unlock them of course. The bonuses in the game were very helpful as the levels progressed, and there seemed to be just the right amount of them (not too much, not too little). I liked that the screen had arrows pointing out the enemies, making it a bit easier to find the last stray enemy.The controls were simple to use and there wasn't anything complicated about this game. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a new, fun game to play. I got this when it was free, but I think it's still worth the money for everything you can do in this game.

I agree with Nashew on all accounts, and admittedly it IS a bit disappointing that there is no plane customization menu. although, I suppose the multiplayer function compensates a bit for that.

I still havent beaten the game, but I think I want to unlock all the planes and this is just anperfect time waster.  I can assure you that this is more than worth the purchase price.Good:*Gameplay is simple enough to jump right in, but deep enough that you don't get bored.*Loads of planes to unlock, and each one plays differently combining one of 7 different weapons with varrying levels of turn, speed, and health.*The mix of enemies on each wave is often challenging, sometimes sending you back to previous levels to unlock a better plane.*Multiplayer (haven't personally tried)Bad:*doesm't look like it would work well on a phone*occasionally the controls lock up, but that might just be my tablet.

Its so much fun, the graphics are great, and the replay value is huge.  I picked this up as the FAOTD and am happy I did, although I would definitely pay the $2.99 for it all day.  There are so many planes to unlock, and lots of challenging levels, I will be playing this one for a while!

However, there are a very limited amount of levels and the unlockable planes aren't unique enough to waste time grinding to unlock them.  It would have been better if you were given a base plane and then play to unlock the speed, armor, design, and weapon upgrades to customize your plane.  Adding achievements, as is the current trend for casual mobile games, would also add a bit more longevity to this title.But for what it is, its a good, cheap time-waster for the week or so it takes you to beat it.

The touchscreen coordinates are completely wrong - tapping on the bottom of the screen acts on the top-most menu item, and tapping on anywhere else does nothing in my case.

The graphics and game play are aces (play on words), but really it's a good game. The music is cute. Unsure if it's worth the full price but for faotd I'll keep it. Will update this review if my opinion changes. It's sad people get hyped on Apple ported apps, android stands its own ground.

It reminds me a bit of a souped-up version of the 2D biplane game from the Intellivision &#34;Triple Action&#34; cartridge, but with powerups and much more lethal AI enemies. It's a keeper.

I found it entertaining. The one thing I didn't liken was it never told you how to get th  x2...x3...x4 etc or the ace shot thing in which you get Jonas points. That's annoying. It's a great game for anyone.

I didn&#8217;t have much success shooting down the birds or the planes, but I loved making the plane fly loop-d-loops.  I also loved flying the plane up toward the stratosphere and outer space (you could tell you are getting too high when the light fades and the sky darkens) and dropping straight down to force a stall.  Once in a stall I would see how close I could get to the ground (and crashing) before I pulled up.  Fun.But while it was fun I had some issues.  My biggest complaint about this game was the placement of the dial that controlled the plane&#8217;s movements.  It was on the left side of the screen, and there was no option to switch it to the right.  As a right handed person I found this cumbersome.  I blame my lack of shooting precision on the placement of the dial and not on my horrible hand-eye coordination.I also had issues with the &#8220;sensitivity&#8221; settings.  I varied it from lowest to highest and I didn&#8217;t notice much of a difference.  It seemed to be stuck on super-sensitive where any little movement of my thumb would send the plane into loops.In playing this game I found that there wasn&#8217;t enough horizontal space to maneuver in.  I could only fly horizontal for a few seconds before I reached the end of the screen and had to turn around.  I was playing on a 7&#8221; Kindle so maybe this isn&#8217;t an issue on larger devices.So a game with lots of potential, but I wouldn&#8217;t try it again until the dial to control movement could be place on the right.

I also like the touch popup menu features and like the swiping from left to right allowing me to move from category to category. Which brings me to the reason why I don't give it 5 stars. I have a list category tittled &quot;News&quot;, when I swipe into that page, the tweets do not load, the page remains blank with turning circle in the center indicating that its loading, but never does. The same thing happens when I swipe into my facebook page, it reads &quot;no news items&quot;, I cant get my facebook timeline. I wonder if anyone else is experiencing a similar problem.

I don't manage my client's social media anymore so I got rid of sprout social. This is awesome because it lets you manage many accounts (I have 3) and you can do actions from any of the 3 without switching. So if I retweet it will ask me which account I want it to be from. The only problem is, that I wanted to follow some of the people on 2 accounts and I had to switch the account but then I couldn't find the whole list. If I wanted to transfer that was easy, I would just unfollow and then follow "using..." and change the account.Not a big deal, because I don't know of any apps that you can do that from anyway, so it's nice if you just want to move the account.Last, there's a bug because I went to edit my profile and then it saved the changes on all 3 of them. I think that sometimes the app gets confused if you switch several times, because it will sometimes open as another account but then it will refresh as the one that I had intended to open. If that makes sense.Overall though, it's a really good twitter app.

It's old, and from before Twidroyd had their API key suspended from the market.  It was out of date even on Amazon's launch day.  If you want to use this app, go to the market.  Hopefully they'll update this here and this review won't apply, but right now it's an old out of date app that doesn't work.  Honestly, this concerns me about the whole Amazon market concept.  If a developer isn't going to update apps here, and if it were a paid app, you'd be out of luck.

Saves going in and out of your browser. The 4 star rating is because &quot;mentions&quot; don't come through like they do in Twitter's app and one recent update temporarily removed the ability to see pic.twitter photos w/o a browser.

For ex, it has a barcode scanner--very easy to use and you don't need any extra app to use it--that automatically adds the scanned food into your tracker. If you are used to counting calories and factoring in exercise (for ex, on a points plan that incorporates both, such as WW) you'll find this app (and the online site) intuitive and simple. Also, the app, unlike the site, gives you a running total of the day's nutrition information all on one page so you can quickly see, for ex, if you haven't had enough protein for the day. Nothing but good things to say about this app.

I highly recommend this app to anyone wanting to lose weight and can be serious about it and honest with yourself about what you are doing. No need to change what you are used to eating but as you begin this you will find you are much more conscience about how many calories are in the tiniest things so that you will want to change how unhealthy eating is affecting you. Good luck to you in this venture to be healthier and since you have found yourself here reading this I truly hope and pray you much success and a long healthy life.

There is a huge database of food, so search and find what you are looking for. Keeps track of exercising and calories burned. Even allows you to list the vitamins and supplements you take! The neatest feature is scanning the barcode of your supplements and foods -it's that easy!The only reason I didn't give it five stars it's because the amazon version is an older version - there it's a newer version on android market. I would get it from there since you can't update the amazon version on android market. Once you get a lot of info entered into the program, you won't want to lose it to delete and re download from android market.

It makes entering foods as easy as can be.The food database is excellent and it's pretty easy to add both custom foods and meals.The my fitness pal site, to which this app is linked is also aces in my book.I can't imagine a better calorie tracking app.I use this and the free version of cardio trainer.  I like this combination much more than calorific or Noom because it is 100% comprehensive and allows me to keep track of things like sodium and protein consumption as opposed to general gross calorie intake.You really can't go wrong with this!

It helps me keep tabs on what I eat so that I begin to understand the calories and how my activity level impacts on it. I only use it when I'm determined to lose weight and when I lose it (or don't), I stop. The first time, I lost about 8 lbs after using it for 2 months.  Then, I stopped using it and I go back for a month or so, whenever I want to lose weight.  My weight loss has leveled off since then and I can't make huge losses again.  However, this was very useful especially if you are a huge foodie like I am.  I like eating a mixed bag of international food and you can find the most obscure food on there too and portion out how much of it you actually ate.

The calories guide works with my  Fitbit to help me balance my diet with my exercise.So far I've lost 16 pounds and am encouraged to continue.  By this time in every other diet plan I've tried I would have given up. Well worthwhile and works on PC, smartphone, android and Kindle Fire.

It also warns you if you didn't eat the minimum suggested calories for the day, which is important. One of the best things about the app is that it breaks down every nutrient and how much you have had of each( calcium, sugar, Vitamin A, etc) and tells you if you've used too much- this has really opened my eyes to the different nutrients that I never really paid attention to when I was doing points plus. Can't do with out it!

Great motivation! If I have a good day, it spurs me on. If I have a so-so day, I can see it's not as bad as a thought. And if I have a terrible day, it makes me realize that it's just one day but I must get back on track.It's then so easy to scan through a day's diary and see what was bad on a day, and what was good. Those bread rolls?  Too high carbs. That isaly's ham? Too much sodium. On so on.I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to manage what they eat but find it hard to do without help. This makes it really easy.

Once you enter your basic information and weight goal, it sets a caloric intake goal for you that is easy to follow. The food database is amazing.. I've only had to enter the nutritional info of one food so far, and everything else shows up by entering the description in the search bar. In addition to the number of calories, it also displays all the nutritional info of all the food that you've eaten that day. It really has made this whole process a lot easier, and I can't wait to finally meet my goal!

I don't use it as religiously as I should but when I do I find it to be quite comprehensive. As a former Weight Watchers member I know the importance of tracking; this app helps me do just that. It has a great database, although there are a lot of repeat entries. Quite easy to add your own favorites.

None worked well or smoothly. This product is simple to use and sync with my computer for later printing of reports and graphs. Only improvement I would recommend would be to include more of the equipment typically found in most gyms. When I looked through exercise tab listing I was surprised that it did not include treadmills. That aside, I would recommend this to anyone who hates counting calories but needs a quick tracking device. Works great on the Kindle Fire!

I am over on calories several days straight because it doesnt want to give credit for my weight training. how is this going to help me lose weight?

I got it from a friends recommendation and in just 5 days I have lost 3 1/2 lbs with no work outs or sacrifices. It really makes you Realize how much you consume In your daily life and overall teaches you to make better eating choices. For example a serving of something maybe small in quantity and not as satisfying with a high calorie count vs something with a larger quantity in a serving which satisfys more due to more in the serving and the calories are equal to or less than your original choice overall its super easy to use and work. And is a new lifestyle one you get the hang of it.

It rivals Weight Watchers online but it's FREE, which gives it a big leg up on WW.  And the fact that I can use this app on my kindle fire (which is always with me) makes it very convenient.I find it fairly easy to enter my food intake on my fitness pal because the database is quite impressive.  It takes just a couple of minutes after each meal to enter my intake, and it keeps track of my running total so I can see at a glance how I'm doing for the day.  The best (and sometimes worst!!) part of the app is that at the end of the day it tells me how much I will weigh in 5 weeks if I keep eating the way I did that day.  Being able to see my potential weight loss gives me a boost of encouragement and motivation; seeing a possible weight gain on the horizon acts as a real wake-up call so that (hopefully) I can do better the following day.  I love that feature!I'm giving this app 4 stars overall ONLY because there are some features that I still haven't tested.  Those that I have tried, however, have earned 5 stars.  Once I test the other features I can post an update.Free, easy to use, and very helpful...what are you waiting for?  Download it now and give it a whirl. =)

But with this a lot of what of what i eat is already imputted though other members. I'm starting to enjoy seeing what I'm doing to myself each day. I especially enjoy the pie chart that shows that percentage of carbs, fats, sodium and protiens I'm consuming everyday.  One bad thing, the weight training. I don't know the names of ill the moves I do (Richard Simmons Totally Toning) so j just end up putting less strenuous walking down. Over all I really like it.

And it's so simple &amp; easy to use!! I highly recommend this app... oh, and by the way... in 30 days, I'm down 14 pounds!!!oh - 1 more thing... you can sync multiple devices. I've got this loaded on my Blackberry, my Kindle Fire, and of course on my PC. so cool.one obstacle to use is if you aren't within wifi signal, you can't add a new item to your diary - I've come up with 2 workarounds.. look up menu before I go to a restaurant (this keeps me honest, too, lol) and add items ahead of time... or just use the notes feature to quicknote what was eaten and add to diary when back within signal.

It's exhausting entering everything, and if your meals only change a little, it would be nice to be able to pick and choose from previous entries, more easily.Should you buy?It's free! Website is free as well, what else can you ask for. If you need something that will help you count calories, this is a great option. Out of the few I tried, myfitnesspal is the one I stuck with.

Problem is I need to really stick to it.  If I've learned anything keep track of what you eat is the best way of losing weight.  But support is the next thing you need.  If you did points but hated the monthly cost of WW, try this.

For instance I made grilled chicken tenders and a macaroni salad. Because my macaroni salad is not listed on the app I can either pick a different one and hope its right or I input ever single item in my salad and try to guess how much of a serving I had. To much work and with my weight loss challenge I want accuracy and a complete program. I don't think I can do that with this.
